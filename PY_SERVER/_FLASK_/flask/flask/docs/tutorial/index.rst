Tutorial
========

Learn by example to develop an application with Python and Flask.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple blogging application. It only
supports one user, only allows text entries, and has no feeds or comments.

While very simple, this example still features everything you need to get
started. In addition to Flask, we will use SQLite for the database, which is
built-in to Python, so there is nothing else you need.

If you want the full source code in advance or for comparison, check out
