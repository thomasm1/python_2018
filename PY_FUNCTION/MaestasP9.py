# Purpose:  Final Project

'''
#1.	5 pts. Add comments as appropriate.  Be sure that your program output is neatly presented to the user.  Add documentation comments to your functions.
2.	For your final project you will use the skills taught throughout the program to create a program you will come up with.
3.	Your program must incorporate the following:
a.	Use of loops and conditionals (while loops and if then for example)
b.	Use of exception handling when getting user input where applicable.
c.	Ability to save and retrieve data using files (csv or text). For example: if you make a game, write the high score.
d.	Ability to get input from the user 
e.	Ability to display information in a readable format
f.	Exhibit a reasonable level of complexity. It should be comparable to the last few programing assignments you have completed. Don’t select too difficult a project!
4.	IMPORTANT: If you use other sources (such as on-line tutorials) to create your program you must reference, in your comments, what you used. Include the name of the organization/person who authored the tutorial and provide a url to the website or a reference to the book used. Your project should involve some modifications to this work and state what modification you made.
Project Ideas

a.	Data Analysis – Similar to what we did in class with the stock analysis. You can take any subject that interests you (baseball, music, literature etc.) download files from the web and derive useful information.  If you want to do more advanced technical data (network data, GIS data) you will need to more data preprocessing to get it into the format you need. 
i.	http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#/Introduction_to_arcpy_mapping/00s300000032000000/ has information on programming python for ArcGIS
b.	Turtle module – You can use the python turtle module to create interesting programs. 
i.	https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html
c.	Python Games – This can be a simple text based game to more complex graphics based games. 
1.	http://www.pygame.org 
2.	http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/ - Has a free downloadable book and sample code
d.	Raspberry Pi related projects - If you are doing a Raspberry Pi some of these requirements may not make sense. You can either go online for raspberry related tutorials or visit the CNM hackerspace that meets on Fridays 10AM -2PM in Smith Brasher.
