## Factory

- A factory is a class that is responsible for creating objects of other types.
- For example, if we were making a game and we wanted to generate different enemies randomly at runtime, we could use a
factory pattern to generate these objects dynamically (all must share the same parent class "Enemy")
- Used when you don't know ahead of time what class object you need
