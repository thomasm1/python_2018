1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,980
And the final line here actually draws the chart on our webpage similar to

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:12,020
a call in D3 to append HTML and SVG elements into a webpage.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,190
And that's it.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,890
A five line bar chart.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,640
Now, it might seem like a lot of overhead to learn a new library to

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,400
do something that D3 already does for us.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,690
But using Dimple will not only allow us to iterate much quicker on

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,700
our visual design process.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,660
But it'll allow us to actually think how we want to when designing charts.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,420
In columns, axes, data types and the relationships between them.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,280
And that is the true power of a well made abstraction or interface or API.
