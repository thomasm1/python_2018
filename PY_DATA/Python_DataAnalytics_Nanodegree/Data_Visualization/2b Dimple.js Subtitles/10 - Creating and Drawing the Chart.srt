00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:07,200
The Dimple code to draw the bar chart is only actually five lines of code.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,410
In D3 this would take around 30 lines, and introduces many

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,530
more sources of error if we have to code 30 lines of code, rather than five.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,570
This really goes a long way to show how proper abstractions can go

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,900
a long way towards developer productivity.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,970
The first line here simply creates a new

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,950
chart object in the specified element with the specified data.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,580
The first argument is a D3 selection that represents the SVG element.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,660
Which we would like to append our Dimple chart to.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,690
And the second argument is a JavaScript object representing the data which we

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,580
would like to display.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,250
In this case, the SVG is, was returned from the d3.select call.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,310
Or what is rather returned from the D3 code

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,360
that initially appends the SVG object.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,630
And the data object passed to dimple.chart is simply the same JavaScript object,

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,520
in this case, an array of JavaScript object literals,

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,540
that gets passed to the draw function callback.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,060
>From our data loading function.

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,820
The data loading function is below our window here but its simply D3's.TSV

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:32,940
function which loads a tab separate value file in this case world cup.tsv.

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,580
And once it gets loaded via AJAX, passes that data content,

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,120
to the draw callback, which we see here.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,400
So the flow, which sometimes takes some getting used to,

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,090
is a call to d3.tsv pass in a data file.

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,920
Once loaded, the data file gets passed to draw.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,180
Which we can see here in our callback function.

27
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,350
And this data object is the same as the contents of our

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,960
World Cup file which then gets passed in to the dimple chart constructor.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,050
There are a few other ways to manipulate the chart object itself if you

30
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,060
are interested.

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,500
And I definitely recommend always reading the documentation of any

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,440
function you use.
