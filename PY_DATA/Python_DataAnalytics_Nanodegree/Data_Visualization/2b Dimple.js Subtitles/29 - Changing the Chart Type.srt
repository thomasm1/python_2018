00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,420
Now after all the setup for

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,240
these few lines of code in Dimple, to make our bar chart, we can

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,010
start having some fun with different chart types with very minimal changes.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,320
And experiment with different types of charts, and different layouts.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,090
To change which chart type we're using to represent our data,

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,600
we simply need to pass a different chart object, to the addSeries method.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,160
In this case we're passing dimple.plot.bar.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,360
But let's try and look at what a scatter plot looks like.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,471
We simply have to change dimple.plot.bar to dimple.plot.scatter, save our file,

10
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,940
and reload the page.
