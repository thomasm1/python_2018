00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,590
And again, since Dimple operates at a higher level of abstraction and

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,420
follows some of the principles of the grammar of graphics.

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,240
To make these changes it's very simple, and

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,450
we simply have to manipulate some properties on our axis and

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,310
Dimple does all the hard work and heavy lifting for us.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,230
But beyond these small formatting changes, to make our chart more readable,

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,590
there's still some fundamental issues with this bar chart.
