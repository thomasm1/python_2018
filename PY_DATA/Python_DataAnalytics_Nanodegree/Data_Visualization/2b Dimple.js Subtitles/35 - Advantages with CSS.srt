1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,330
Refreshing our page you see here that it

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,680
correctly appended the header to our page but that it's slightly off.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,630
Again we can make a simple fix with CSS to center our header.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,300
Back in our code we simply select the H2 elements on our page and

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,100
change the text align to be center.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,020
And going back to our chart we see here.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,450
The World Cup Attendance title has properly been centered on our page.

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,360
And hopefully this shows you the benefit that d3 provides us by allowing us to

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
use standard CSS and HTML knowledge that

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,090
we might have gathered from web development to create great data visualizations.
