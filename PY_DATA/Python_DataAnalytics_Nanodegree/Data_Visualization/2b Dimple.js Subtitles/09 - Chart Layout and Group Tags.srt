00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,470
As you can see, Dimple.js's API is much closer to

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,060
what the grammar of graphics specifies than d3 itself.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,370
This is because Dimple.js exists at a higher level of abstraction than d3,

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,850
and since the grammar of graphics is at a little bit of

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,490
a higher level of abstraction as well.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,510
Dimple happens to fit nicely with the grammar of graphics specification.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,520
The first few lines of code here are simply standard JavaScript,

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,500
which set up the variables for the width, height, and margins of the chart.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,410
As well as the d3 code, which append an SVG element on our page.

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,640
The declaration here to use strict lets the browser know that you

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,740
want to enforce a restricted subset of JavaScript within this function.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,390
The most important feature of strict mode is that it forces the browser

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,870
to throw explicit errors anytime JavaScript might silently fail.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,840
Similar to what we saw in the first lesson for HTML elements.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,330
These lines of code simply tell the browser to find the body tag,

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,620
append a new SVG element, add appropriate attributes for

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,060
the width and the height and then add a group with class chart.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,950
We haven't seen a group yet.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,010
But all the group does is, groups the SVG and everything within it,

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,490
into a single element.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,720
Think of this is as the same way as webpages often use div

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,390
tags to group common elements together, such as, paragraphs or side bars.
