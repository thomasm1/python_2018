1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,200
Rather than telling you which chart I would choose and why,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,915
since we have the power of a web-based visualization library at our disposal,

3
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:11,710
dimple.js, you do not have to take my word for it.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,660
We can experiment with each of the chart types.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,550
A common theme that we will be bring up over and

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,330
over again throughout the course is the process of iterating on a visualization.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,270
This is often called prototyping or sketching.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,780
I wanted to show you the process I went through to come to

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,150
my own conclusions about the chart type and

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,490
hopefully make designing visualizations seem much less mysterious.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,280
And since there is never truly a right answer with visualizations,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,740
just like there's no right way to write a book or

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,430
a news article, once empowered with the insights I will now go through,

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,120
you can hopefully extend and adapt my visualization to make it your own.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,380
We will see later in this lesson why some of the design decisions that

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,730
the creator of D3 made makes this process of iterating and

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,170
experimenting with visual displays quite seamless.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,190
And sometimes, even if there is a right or best chart to visualize your data,

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,250
you often don't know ahead of time how the data will interact with the aesthetic

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,640
of your visualization, including things like layout, color, scales, and

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,860
how will it interact with the web page itself.

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,260
We have already seen which aspects of the grammar of graphics the creator of D3

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,540
chose to implement in his design decisions for the library, and how this makes

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,875
the process of iterating and experimenting with visual displays quite seamless.
