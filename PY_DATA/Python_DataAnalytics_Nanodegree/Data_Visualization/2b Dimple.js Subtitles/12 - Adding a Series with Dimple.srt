1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,140
The fourth line here, with a call to add series,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,050
simply specifies what type of chart we would like to make.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,360
In this case,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,550
we pass a dimple.plot.bar chart to the add series called on my chart.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,170
In nuance here, that we'll get into later,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,230
this first mysterious argument that we pass in as null.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,260
Dimple J S, being the high level charting library that it is,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,450
allows us to facet our data or droop it by another column.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,480
If we wanted to say plot our data by attendance per year but

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,680
also droop it by let say the stage of the World Cup, we could pass as the first

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,850
argument to the series stage, which will first group our data by stage and

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,490
then make a bar plot of the specified axes on the chart.
