1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,020
We can add an axis to our chart simply by calling an axis method and

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,610
the chart object.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:12,440
Since our x axis represents years, we use the addTimeAxis method and

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,120
specify that the x axis should correspond to the year field of our data.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,450
Let's finish this by adding a semicolon, which is not only a good

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,950
JavaScript best practice, but in some cases your code will run into errors if

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,050
you don't include one after every line, and then add an axis to our chart.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,540
Previously, we tried to inspect my chart and it was quite hard to understand

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,910
what all the methods and properties meant, but let's inspect our x axis.

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,880
If we look here, its a dimple.axis object, and

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,650
it specified the chart it belongs to, the position,

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,690
in this case the x axis, and also what fields it corresponds to.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,440
Something to note here,

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,349
that the chart property define our axis actually is a reference to

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,680
the chart object we created earlier, rather than just an identifier string.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,570
And we've tried printing out what this chart object is x.chart,

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,420
we get the same object as we got when we printed out myChart.

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,800
As you can see here, they're both dimple.chart objects and

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,700
they both have all of the same properties.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,290
Now this is possible even if two objects aren't identical, but

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,680
if they have the same properties defined.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Going one step farther,

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,680
we can actually compare the myChart object with the triple equals to x.chart.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,300
In this case, it says myChart is exactly equal to the axis chart property.
