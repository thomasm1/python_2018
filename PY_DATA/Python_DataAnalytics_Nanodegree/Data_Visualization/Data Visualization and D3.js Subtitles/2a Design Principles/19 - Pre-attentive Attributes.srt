00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,110
Preattentive processing taps into our automatic processes of

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,030
vision and perception.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,950
When preattentive processing occurs,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,150
we are able to instantly recognize an element in a visualization.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,920
It's the same reason why this blue bar becomes instantly apparent in

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,210
this forest of orange bars.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,530
Here I'm using color, in particular, hue as preattentive attribute.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,120
I could also use color intensity to create the same effect.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
Here two bars pop out from the page.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,960
So color hue and color intensity can be used as preattentive attributes.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,329
But there are also other preattentive attributes that can,

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,437
we can use to highlight information or to lead the eye in visualizations.

13
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:46,067
In Colin Ware's book Information Visualization Perception for

14
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:50,030
Design, he describes four general categories for these attributes.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,370
And they are color, form, movement and spatial position.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,350
We can change the form of objects, such as their line width, curvature, size or,

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,320
in this case, the shape.

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,690
Movement is another form of preattentive processing.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,380
For these squares, I'm using a flicker effect to draw attention to one of them.

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,190
You might have similar fade ins or

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,790
fade outs for portions of your visualization that are interactive or

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,140
those that highlight particular data values or trends in a visualization.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,390
Finally, spacial position can be employed as preattentive attribute.

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,700
You might find this useful for

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,920
drawing the eye towards titles, legends, or annotations.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,100
For more examples of preattentive processing check out the links in

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,080
the instructor notes.

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,100
As a side note, preattentive attributes can be used together but

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,880
they may achieve different results.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,470
Here, color and form are used.

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,160
Notice that form either a square or

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,710
a circle is randomly distributed throughout the grid.

33
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,970
But the color attribute creates a clean boundary down the grid.

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,870
In this example, the reverse is true.

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,390
Color is randomly distributed to shapes throughout this grid, but

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,230
notice that form does not do the partitioning of the grid as well as in

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,340
this previous example.

38
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,180
In this second example, the horizontal shape boundary is masked by color or hue.
