00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,730
The last relationship I want to cover, is that of proportions or comparisons.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,920
If you have multiple categories and want to show how the magnitude of

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,420
each compares to every other, you can use a stacked or unstacked bar chart.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,350
These bar charts, however, can also be used to show how

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,070
a distribution changes over time between the categories.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,050
If you remember from the previous video, much into our charts in this case what

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,890
the author labels as a column chart can be used to represent a distribution.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,010
And if we simply put every column of our bar chart side by side and

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,990
visualize how it changes, we can compare each of the categories.

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,210
And last but not least, we get to deal with some food.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,360
Pie charts and donut charts convey proportions of a whole.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,790
I tend to shy away from pie charts because they can be visually misleading and

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,730
rather use a stacked bar or

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,940
simply a table to represent the proportions of the whole.
