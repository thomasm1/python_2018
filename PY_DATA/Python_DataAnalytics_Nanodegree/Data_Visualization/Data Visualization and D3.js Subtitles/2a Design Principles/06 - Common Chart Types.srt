1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,390
While each chart type might be slightly better for

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,180
slight differences in your data, and

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,250
what you're trying to communicate, in practice you can get by with only a few.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,380
In navigating this jungle, I like to often start from first principles.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,720
Chart types are simply a set of visual encodings applied to data types, and

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,200
combined with some relationship between those data.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,290
For example, a scatterplot is an x coordinate and y coordinate with a shape,

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,820
in this case a circle as applied to two continuous variables,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,810
continuous being their data type, in which the y value is dependent on

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,250
the x value, which corresponds to the relationship between them.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,930
And combining all three of these things.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,190
You get the chart type of a scatter plot.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,540
As you can imagine, there are quite a few combinations of these three sets.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,420
A set of the Visual Encodings possible, a set of Data Types possible,

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,400
a set of Relationships between your data types.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,210
I think this flow chart does a fairly good job of categorizing the different

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,990
chart types by utility.

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,520
But I'll also add that I think a few are missing.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,690
And I do have a few qualms about how Andrew chooses his branches about which

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,120
chart to use given which situation.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,110
When choosing a chart type, I usually either start with the type and

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,780
dimension of my data, or

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,700
what relationships I'm trying to convey between my different columns.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,110
For example, I might ask myself, how many dimensions do I have?

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,190
One dimension, two dimension, three dimensions.

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,570
And what type is each?

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,140
Continuous, categorical.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,110
Am I trying to compare two variables,

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,150
am I trying to show how one variable is distributed?

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,390
Let's take that last question as a starting point.

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,370
Let's say I have one dimensional data that I'm

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,480
trying to see the distribution of.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,360
I would use either a histogram for

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,450
continuous data, and I might possibly want to bin it.

35
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,660
Or a bar chart for categorical data, if I might have

36
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,770
some discrete values along the x axis that don't have any intrinsic order.

37
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,740
If I want to show a comparison of distributions, I'll use either a box plot, or

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,520
small multiples.

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,250
As they represent distributions of multiple variables,

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,310
side by side with each other.

41
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,128
We'll get into what each of these looks like in just a second.

42
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:16,320
But I want to mention them as you were talking about chart types to

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,440
represent distributions of data types and variables.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,800
To represent a correlation between two variables where the y variable is

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,260
dependent on the x variable, a scatter plot is the most effective way and

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,300
the most commonly known.

47
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,880
A scatter plot can be generalized to a bubble chart [INAUDIBLE] Additional

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,410
dimension in visual encoding to represent, in this case the bubble chart

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,220
uses size of each of it's circles to represent a third variable.

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,590
A subtlety of the scatter plot, that the x variable is usually assumed to

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,270
be independent and uncorrelated with the other x values.

52
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,130
What does this mean exactly?

53
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,650
Well let's consider time series data.

54
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,140
When dealing with time, every data point is implicitly dependant on all

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,690
the data points that came earlier in time before it.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,250
In this situation.

57
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,550
We want to use a line chart or

58
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,500
a multiple line chart to represent time series data.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,640
That one has intrinsic order.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,460
And two has data points that are dependent on what came before them.

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,540
With line charts the fact that every point is connected.

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,040
Shows a trend in your data and

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,160
implies that every data point does have this inherent connection between them.
