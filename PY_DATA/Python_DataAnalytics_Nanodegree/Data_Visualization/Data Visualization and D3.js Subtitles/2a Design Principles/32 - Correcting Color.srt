Maps can suffer from poor coloring as well,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,770
let's look at a few examples on this catastrophe blog.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,120
This first map was submitted by a wind energy company looking to

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,210
build more wind farms.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,420
The map shows the expected amount of noise that the wind farm was

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,030
going to generate.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,760
As you can see, this map suffers from high contrast and bright colors.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,110
This map further down is just a sea of black labels.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,070
You can't actually make out many of the labels in here.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,250
If you have more time, I recommend reading through some of these examples to

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,090
get a better idea of how you can utilize color in your own visualizations.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,790
The good news is, is that even if you're not sure which colors to use,

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,929
there's a wealth of resources at your disposal.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,700
Cynthia Brewer, a Professor of Geography at Penn State, developed ColorBrewer.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,920
Which contains a set of web, print, and color blind friendly colors.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,210
While her work mainly focused on maps,

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,920
many of the color sequences, including sequential, diverging and

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,239
qualitative can be effective choices when creating most data visualizations.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,910
And if you want even more color palettes, you can check out Adobe's cooler

20
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,420
to either pick popular ones, or create your own.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,190
The links to those websites can be found in the instructor's notes.
