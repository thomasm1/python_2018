1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,110
Your next big goal in this course is to recreate a visualization to improve it.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,820
In order to do that, I'm going to be teaching you some design principles that

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,840
can enhance your graphics and help you prototype.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,270
>> I'll also take you through how to refine a design, and

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,690
also a few metrics that'll help you measure their effectiveness.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,970
>> We'll be seeing all the different options we have for choosing a chart or

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,850
a graphic depending on our data.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,210
And learn some of the formalism and

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,860
theory surrounding how to make that selection.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,790
We'll also be building a much more complicated graphic,

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,080
using a library built upon D3, and see how we can engage our audience more.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's go learn about charts now.
