00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,030
The grammar of graphics was not created purely for

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,580
logistical reasons though it does have that nice side effect of not having to

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,830
repeat work if specifications change.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,390
By separating the underlying data from the means of presenting that data,

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,770
you can think separately about each visual element and the structure and

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,280
form of that data.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,190
This allows us to both transform and manipulate our data without having to

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,810
worry about the visual representation and what might get messed up.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,000
And the last great effect I'll go over of separating our

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,090
data from the visual presentation of that data is to allow for

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,580
very interesting collaboration across teams.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,320
Let's say possibly between a designer who works on

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,380
the visual aesthetic separately from developers or

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,340
engineers who might work on transforming and merging data.
