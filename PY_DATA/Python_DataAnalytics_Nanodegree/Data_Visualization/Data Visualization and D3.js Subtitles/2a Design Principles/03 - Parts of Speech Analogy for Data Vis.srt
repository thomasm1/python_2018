00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, you might be wondering why we care about parts of speech.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,480
I thought this was a visualization course.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,530
Well, I would argue that parts of

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,290
speech are to sentences what visual encodings are to charts.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,860
Just as sentences are composed of parts of speech,

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,050
which each contribute differently to the overall message of the sentence,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,700
charts are composed of different visual encodings,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,310
each of which most effectively convey a specific aspect of the underlying data.

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,010
Wikipedia defines a chart as a graphical representation of

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,479
data in which the data is represented by symbols.

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,990
It then goes on to give examples, such as bars in a bar chart,

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,330
lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,230
I'll be using the word chart in this lesson in

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,010
a slightly more constrained manner to mean a common pattern or

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,310
convention for combining visual encodings or symbols.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,160
And while there might be an infinite number of ways you can

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,190
create a sentence through different parts of speech, in practice,

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,720
there are a limited number of combinations that make sense, and

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,320
an even smaller number that people use in practice.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,790
Part of this is due to the constraints and rules of language and

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,730
grammar, but part of it comes from the fact that it's easier to

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,130
understand patterns that are familiar.

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,980
For example, you'll never see a sentence that has no verbs and only nouns.
