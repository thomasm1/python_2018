1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,800
Overall, I would say that these colors distract from the data.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,150
The colors shown don't appear to be chosen for any particular reason.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,510
In fact, they're actually the default rainbow colors for the ggplot2 package for

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,721
the R programming language.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,590
These colors are also quite bright, which strains the eyes, and above all,

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,550
each color doesn't actually convey any additional information about the data.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,490
The labels on the left side of the bar plot are enough to

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,700
indicate which bar belongs to which type of diamond cut.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,900
This actually makes the use of color redundant since both the labels and

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,490
the color are indicating the cut type.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,310
You also might have thought that the legend at the right here is unnecessary.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,650
We could simply design this visualization with the labels at the left in

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,930
the graph, decreasing the time for

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,220
the reader's eye to bounce between the legend and the main data display.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,060
Now, I know this is a small display, but this makes sense for

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,960
larger visualizations where the eye would be scanning across an entire page.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,370
So, when it comes to color, what should you do?
