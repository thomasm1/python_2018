00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,990
Now that we've seen some of the most common types of charts and

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,880
learned about how the grammar of graphics helps us separate data from our

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,960
visual representation of that data.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,684
I want to show you to how to put this theory into practice using D-3 and

5
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:15,710
Associate Technologies.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,580
As covered in Lesson One.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,300
The visualization stack for different technologies can go pretty deep.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,040
At the top of this spectrum, we have graphical tools such as RAW or Excel.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,390
They let us very quickly and easily create predefined charts for

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,380
our data, but lack flexibility.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,290
At the low end of the spectrum are technologies like Canvas, WebGL, and

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,190
SVG itself.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,590
These low level tools at the bottom of the spectrum are the most flexible but

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,740
give you an interface similar to a painter.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,110
You must specify pixels and

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,610
colors to do something even as simple as drawing a line.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,190
And just forget about making dynamic charts and binding data.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,570
Since we will be working somewhere in the middle of this spectrum when working

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,310
with charts, I do not yet want to deal with all the complexities of raw D3.

20
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,740
D3 is often confused for a charting library, when in fact

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,910
they exist at one level lower and also one level below the grammar of graphics.

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,840
And think of D3 as the building blocks that someone might use if they want to

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,480
create a charting library with Excel-like plotting functionality.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,220
And that is exactly what many people have done.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,310
We will be using a library called Dimple.js for the slide coding example.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,100
It's implemented on top of D3,

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,740
which in turn is implemented on top of SVG, JavaScript, and HTML.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,050
And provides us a very nice abstraction for building charts, and allows us to

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,160
think in the way that we might want to when concerning the grammar of graphics.
