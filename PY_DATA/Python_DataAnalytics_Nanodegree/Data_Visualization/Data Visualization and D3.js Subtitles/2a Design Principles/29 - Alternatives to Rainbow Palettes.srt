00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,340
Here's another bit about color.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,860
Contrary to popular belief, the rainbow effect is not an optimal color scale for

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,029
human visual perception.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,360
This visualization displays the endothelial sheer stress, or

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,620
simply the pressure on different parts of artery walls.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,250
Areas of low pressure, as shown in blue are troublesome and

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,340
can lead to heart attacks.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,530
Michelle Borkin, a researcher at Harvard School of Engineering and

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,900
Applied Science, conducted a study to determine whether visualizations like this

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,560
rainbow model, could be improved to increase the accuracy and

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,510
speed of the diagnosis of heart disease.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,110
In her study, she tested whether two-dimensional models were better than

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,160
the three-dimensional models.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,410
So here's the three-dimensional model, and here's the two-dimensional model.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,190
But you might notice that she also tested something else.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,720
She tested whether the standard rainbow colors,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,750
which are found among many default settings in visualization software

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,730
outperformed the type of color palette shown here.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,650
So, what type of color palette is shown here?

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,280
Type in your answer here.
