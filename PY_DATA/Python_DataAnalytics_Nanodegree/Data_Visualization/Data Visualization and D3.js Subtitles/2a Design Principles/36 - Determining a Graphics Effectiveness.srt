00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,180
You just learned about some design principles that can enhance your

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,050

00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,950
Including pre-attentive processing, negative space, and color.

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,290
>> But there's actually more that we can do.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,320
It's important to think about data visualizations as a cohesive whole, and

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,650

In this next section, we'll go over how to remove elements from

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,460
visualizations and also a few metrics to measure their effectiveness.

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,610
Let's go over a few examples now.
