00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,090
I don't want to go into the specifics of each of the grammar of

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,220
graphics very abstract principles as seen here as variables, and algebra,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,280
scales, statistics, geometry, coordinates, aesthetics, and our renderer.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,060
And even though you may think you're familiar with variables,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,513
in the context of the grammar of graphics this is slightly different than

6
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:22,580
JavaScript variables for example.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,380
And while you may think you understand geometry and

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,550
possibly have studied it in school, the geometry of the grammar of graphics

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,360
specifies is slightly different than the geometry many people are familiar with.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,500
Hopefully by tying each of these very abstract principles to associate d3

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,730
concepts, such as the d3 data loading, the d3 scale link.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,050
Appending rectangles, circles and lines and using CSS to

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,010
style a graphic we can make the grammar of graphics theory much more concrete.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,610
Also, since d3 has a very chainable API this concept of a pipeline

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,379
fits very naturally with how d3 creates graphics to render on a webpage.
