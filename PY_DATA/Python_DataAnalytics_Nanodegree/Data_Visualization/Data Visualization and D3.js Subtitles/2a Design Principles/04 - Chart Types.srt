00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,000
I just mentioned that the rules of grammar enforce certain constraints on

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,780
written and spoken language.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,880
Later in the lesson, we will get into a similar set of rules for

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,500
visualizations and charts called the Grammar of Graphics.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,560
But for now, I simply want to show you a few of the most common chart types.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,150
I mentioned that there are a finite amount of possible charts.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,080
But even so finite can still be quite a large number as you can see here and

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,350
there are even more charts that are not included.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,500
This is a flow chart created by Andrew Abela to

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,310
help navigate the somewhat overwhelming amount of different chart types.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,600
Which in and of it's self, is quite effective.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,810
You can find a larger PDF of this graph on extremepresentation.com.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,040
Which is Andrew Abela's site.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,490
And all the choices of possible chart types, I've seen very great.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,110
You always have to consider how familiar an audience is with a given chart type

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,790
and how long a graphic takes to digest.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,380
When I say digest here, I really mean understand and interpret.
