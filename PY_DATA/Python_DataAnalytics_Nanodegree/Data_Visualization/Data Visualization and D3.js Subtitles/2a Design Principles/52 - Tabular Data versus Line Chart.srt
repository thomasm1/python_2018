1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,510
One thing that's much easier to interpret from our line plot

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,520
is any trend in the data.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,265
We can see here the short dips in attendance,

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:16,390
that occur fairly regularly with some period, these might be weekends.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,040
And we see another fairly large drop towards the end of the year.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,320
And while the flu may be apparent in the tabular data due to the sharp and

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,380
somewhat extended decline in attendance.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,070
It is much easier to spot with the visual representation of the data.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,250
And other more subtle patterns, such as weekend dips,

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,260
may be impossible to notice from the tabular representation alone.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,330
This is due to the fact that is it not dipped to zero or close to zero.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,780
Let's say because there is weekend classes or

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,410
extracurricular activities, and is only apparent when you

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,620
look at the pattern over time of the periodic activity of ups and downs.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,900
Let's say, however,

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,210
that I want to know how many students were in school on January 14.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,620
Since we're interesting in simply looking up

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,720
a specific attendance on a specific day,

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,530
the table is much easier to understand as we can look to the exact row we need.

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,390
And look across to

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,900
the single number that represents the attendance for that day.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,580
Often this behavior of drilling down to a specific datum,

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,220
in this case January 14.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,820
Can be incorporated into a visual graphic through animation and

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,120
annotation which is actually what Dimple.js,

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,790
the library we will use in just a second allows us to do.

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,700
But in this example of a static chart is much easier to

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,532
look up the attendance for a single day in the table.

29
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:49,120
Rather than have to look at a potentially large and

30
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,130
nuanced plot of days and go across to attendance.
