00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,390
My first piece of advice comes from the design field.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,770
Get It Right In Black And White.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,500
Before you begin adding color to your data visualization,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,940
you should determine if you need color in the first place.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,680
Many times, black, white and

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,800
shades of grey will be enough to effectively convey your information.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,200
Secondly if you are going to use color,

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,120
consider using less intense colors, such as natural colors or pastels.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,600
You can also add some gray value to bright colors, to make them less vibrant.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,590
Colors with higher gray values have a softer feel, and

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,190
the eye can concentrate on them for longer periods of time.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,670
Rainbow colors, primary colors, and

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,810
other bright bold colors, can create noisy visualizations which strain the eye.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,780
Even if all these bars were a bright red color,

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,360
I probably wouldn't want to stare at it too long.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
As you encounter graphics, you should look for

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,880
this to determine how this is affecting you as a viewer.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,750
My final tip is to make color selections thar facilitate communication.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,440
In this example, I used a complimentary color to draw attention to

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,040
the count of ideal cut diamonds.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,910
You could use a similar strategy if you want to highlight particular data

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,750
points in a graphic.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,670
Perhaps you've come across some good and not so

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,059
good examples of color use in data visualizations.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,220
I'd like you to go grab a data visualization from the wild, be it the internet,

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,420
a newspaper, magazine, or perhaps even a scientific paper.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,920
I want you to describe how color is used in the graphic, and whether or

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,650
not you think the use of color is effective.

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,430
Maybe you can think of some ways the designer might have done something else.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,520
Share your example on the discussion thread titled, Communicating with Color.

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,140
In your post, describe how color is used.

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,650
And how it encodes data, or maybe it's doing something else instead.

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,940
