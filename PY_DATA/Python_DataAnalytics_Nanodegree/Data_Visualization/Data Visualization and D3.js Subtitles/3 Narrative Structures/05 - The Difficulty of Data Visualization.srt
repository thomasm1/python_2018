1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:04,303
Now that you have a high level overview of the data visualization process, let's

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:08,334
dive a little bit deeper into how we might start collecting data for ourselves.

3
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:11,343
>> But before we dive deeper into learning about getting cleaning data,

4
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:13,360
I want to you hear from Scott Murray again.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,460
Scott is going to share with you one common misconception that people have

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,310
about data visualization.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,220
What are the most common mistakes that you see people make when they're

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,950
just starting with data visualizations?

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,240
>> Well the, yeah,

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,390
most common is probably thinking that it's mostly about visualization.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,740
Because that's like the fun, pretty, cool, exciting part for most people.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,380
It's, typically there's a lot of like the data part that's involved.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,500
You know, like maybe your work is going to actually be 90% finding the data,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,410
verifying the data,

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,090
parceling the data, filtering the data like exploring the data.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,460
And the visualization is often just kind of like that last step.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,120
Which can sometimes be really disheartening especially if you're you know,

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
coming in expecting to like, make great graphics or whatever, which you can,

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,870
but there's sort of all this leg work that, that happens right before that.

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,770
So, that's kind of, I think one, one issue is about expectations coming in.
