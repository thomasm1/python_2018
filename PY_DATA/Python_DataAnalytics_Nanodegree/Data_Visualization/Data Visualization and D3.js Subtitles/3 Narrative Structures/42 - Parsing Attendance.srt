1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,450
The operator I've used here, simply a single plus prepended to

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,820
the attendance field, is what's called the unary operator.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,310
It's a little JavaScript trick to convert a string into an integer.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm sure if you've used JavaScript or other programming languages,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,440
you've used the unary plus operator's sister, the unary negation operator.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,730
In this case, a single minus sign.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,240
In this case, with a single minus sign, we're simply negating the value.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,650
Which usually makes pretty intuitive sense.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,740
The unary plus, on the other hand, looks a little bit more strange.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,030
Again, whatever you put it in front of, it tries to convert into a numeric form.

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,120
In this case, since attendance is an integer, it will convert it

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,450
into an integer and then update the value of the attendance column.

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,180
If we try to use the unary plus or

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,420
the unary negative on something like a string that doesn't have

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,700
a natural numeric representation, we'll simply get not a number back.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,210
And if you're curious, I encourage you to experiment in a web browser console or

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,370
other JavaScript environment
