00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,190
One key paradigm in D3 that we haven't explicitly covered,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,190
since dimple js abstracted it away from us, and

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,250
in all the coding we did in lesson one, we didn't have any bound data,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,010
is the anonymous function as a call back, to access an element's bound data.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,270
It's an anonymous function, because it's not given a name.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,840
And if you come from other languages like to Python,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,010
it's very similar to the lambda.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,180
And I call it an accessor function because it allows us to

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,830
change the behavior of a generic D3 function.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,930
Here I'm working with the extent to act differently depending on what we return.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,900
So again this anonymous function is accessing the attendance in our data.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,720
So pulling out the bound attendance values.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,350
And since we're returning them.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,330
The extent happens across the attendance column and returns the minimum and

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,220
maximum values.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,810
Again in this case we're using the same d3.extent, we're passing the same data.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,050
And hopefully you were wondering previously how do we get a time extent and

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,790
the count extent from very similar code?

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,800
Well the answer is the anonymous accessor function.

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,020
For the time we return the date and for

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,320
the attendance or count extent we simply return the attendance.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,830
And while this function's quite simple in both these cases.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,220
You can perform all sorts of complicated logic within.

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,640
And this is exactly how d3 makes its charts data driven.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,610
The data bind, or .data function is only one side of the coin.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,650
The other side is the anonymous accessor function, because after all.

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,050
What good is bound data, if there's no way for us to access and use it?
