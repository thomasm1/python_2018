1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,939
Now that we have some sense of how traditional journalism approaches creating

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,040
stories and crafting narratives.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,860
I wanted to contrast it with the new approaches that data

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,239
journalism takes to create engaging and often interactive visualizations.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,150
Traditionally, journalists have used data and

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,680
charts as evidence to support a claim.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,830
Often in the form of a static image embedded within the larger body of text.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,530
For example, you might be reading a news article that uses

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,560
a chart to support some claim it makes in the overall narrative.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,190
I say here data around narrative to refer to

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,310
the fact that the narrative is the focus of the journalist piece and

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,140
the data merely exists in a secondary and supporting role.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,920
Data journalism on the other hand places the data front and

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
center and builds a narrative around the data.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,240
For example, a data journalist might have some interesting data set.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,060
And try to tell a story about what's happening in that data set.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,280
In comparison to an article that has a static chart embedded to support claims

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,000
made, a data journalist might have an interactive chart, which they then use

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,770
labels, annotations, and sidebars to add context to the data.

20
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,790
And by adding context to the data,

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,840
they'll create a narrative around the story they want to tell with their chart.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,520
The second difference I wanted to point out is that traditional journalism

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,440
often presents its information as a sequence of events.

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,720
A then b then c to create a linear narrative.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,220
Data journalism on the other hand leverages interactivity to

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,660
enable much more complex and varied narrative structures.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,530
Allowing the user to discover their own data story possibly from going

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,340
from event A, to event C, back to event A, maybe going to some

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,480
external article or other information Z, which leads back to conclusion B.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,090
In this case.

31
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,790
The structure of the story and

32
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,210
the narrative that you tell may be different and customized for every reader.

33
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,290
Whereas in traditional journalism you might write a single story with

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,840
a single linear flow so no matter who's reading it, the story stays the same.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,110
And the last aspect that I want to compare is the method of

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,373
delivery or dissemination.

37
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:42,250
Traditional journalism is published either in a physical form like a newspaper

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,110
or magazine or on the web, but often only as static html.

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,600
Thought of like a digital book.

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,150
The new visualizations coming out of data journalism outlets like

41
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,650
the New York Times or 538 leverage many of the open web technologies

42
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,810
that we discussed in lesson one to create both more accessible articles.

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,820
And also interactive visualizations then

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,390
enable much richer interaction from the reader.
