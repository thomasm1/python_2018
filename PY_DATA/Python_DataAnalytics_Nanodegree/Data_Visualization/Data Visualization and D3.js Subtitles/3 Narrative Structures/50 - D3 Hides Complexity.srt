00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,370
D3 isn't necessarily magic, but it hides a lot of complexity for you.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,090
So it might seem mysterious.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,790
But if you dig deep enough,

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,710
you can always find out where the source of what it's doing is.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,960
In this case, the data attribute in the DOM.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,410
And something I don't advise, but you can do, is you actually mutate the data of

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,970
this circle by changing individual fields on the .__data__attribute.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,050
And again, this is a somewhat bad practice unless you

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,730
know exactly what you're doing since it could lead to issues of data corruption,

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,480
here we've simply changed the attendance of the first gain to 1 million.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,860
But enough fooling around.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,670
Let's get back to the code and actually draw some circles.
