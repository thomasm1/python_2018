00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:05,320
Something that Nick Felton talked about at the last Eyeo Festival,

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,870
with his new annual report that just came out.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,780
He collected so much data, for this project.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,973
In, in the past he's collected the data in manual form on paper and

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,010
then he developed an app so that he could record stuff himself.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,730
For this year he collected data from like all kinds of news sources.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,550
So it was like all his emails,

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,770
all of his text messages all of his phone records, plus a bunch of stuff that he

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,935
was collecting manually, plus all of his geographic locations.

10
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:35,890
So for the phones we're doing a lot of this tracking for him, and

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,800
what I think was really interesting about that project is that the number of

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
data sources were or number of values were so

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,020
big that he could no longer manage it in the manual form.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,700
Like, he used to do this project with Excel sheets, and to

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,700
me that's when that project became like a big data project,

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,610
because he had to relinquish some control to the algorithm or to the software.

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,040
We said, okay, well make me a map of all the places that I've been and

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
he could make this, like he could let the software make this map.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,040
And, then as a human being who had, who lived through this he could look

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,710
at the map and say, well I know that's not right because I never went there.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,290
So this was a glitch in the GPS or

22
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,160
this was, you know, this was a glitch in my email system or something.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,310
But I think it's really interesting that he's made the decision to leave those

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,120
glitches in there.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,690
Like, the things that I am calling glitches are really just kind of

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,855
side effects of the data tracking process.

27
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:39,280
>> Mm-hm. >> And side effects of the algorithm, and how it's being applied.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
So I think, connecting that to the question.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,940
What's interesting about that to me is,

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,990
when you're talking about what's subjective and what's objective.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,500
It gets really fuzzy when you get the algorithm involved, right?

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,270
because you have. You have sort of my point of view.

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,920
You have maybe like a more balanced objective point of view.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,480
But then you also have the point of view that's being represented by

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,314
your code or by the tools that you're using.

36
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,912
[CROSSTALK]. >> Yeah the data itself right?

37
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:02,649
And how it's collected.

38
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:03,557
>> Yeah the data itself.

39
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,030
The process that we use, use to collect it.

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,074
The technology that was maybe reliable or not that was used and collected.

41
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:13,120
So, yeah I don't know.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,440
So I don't know what, what is like an objective truth in that, you know,

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,410
in that kind of project.

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,690
Yeah but it's, it's really interesting.
