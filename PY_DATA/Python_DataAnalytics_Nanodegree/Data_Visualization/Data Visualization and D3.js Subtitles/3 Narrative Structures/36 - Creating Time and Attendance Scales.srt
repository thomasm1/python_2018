1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,140
And to map the date and the attendance from their initial data values

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,270
to an actual pixel value, we use D3's scale function.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,450
One thing that we haven't seen before is how to deal with time in D3.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,200
Notice, rather than just using d3.scale, we're first going into

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,530
the d3.time module, and then calling the scale function contained within.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,120
For our attendance, or our count scale, since attendance is an integer,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,550
we can directly use d3.scale and then use a linear function within.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,080
And for both the time scale and the count scale, the domain we're

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,330
mapping from is the minimum and maximum dates, in this case the time extent for

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,570
the attendance, it's the minimum and maximum attendance.

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,720
In this case, count_extent, which get mapped into the range for

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,670
the x axis, the margin to the width.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,840
So basically, the left-most part of our chart and

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,640
the right-most part of our chart.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,330
And for the y axis, the quirk of SVG where it has an inverted coordinate plane,

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,290
a y value of zero is actually at the top of the webpage.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,750
And as the y value increases, you go down the page, so

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,260
in this case, the minimum value of attendance starts at the height of our chart.

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,170
So at the very bottom.

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,430
And it goes up into the top of the chart, in this case, margin.
