00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,830
One of the most common reasons for incorrectly interpreting data

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,400
stems from the difference between correlation and causation.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,274
If we use some logical notation borrowed from math,

4
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:20,720
a correlation can simply be stated as both A and B either go up or down.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,861
You could also have an anti-correlation, where when A goes up, B goes down.

6
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:32,980
The difference with causation is typically one event happens before the other.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,396
In this case, if A, then B.

8
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:40,994
In this case, causation is often a much

9
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:46,454
stronger assumption in effect than merely a correlation.

10
00:00:46,454 --> 00:00:50,690
To make this a little bit more concrete, I want to go through a simple example.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,190
Let's say that as the number of movies produced in a year increases,

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,790
the observed incidence of cancer in a population increases as well.

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,640
Now, you might be able to say that as the number of movies produced increases,

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,110
people go to the movies more often and

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,100
thus exercise less, increasing cancer incidence in the population.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,330
And while that may be true, an analyst might

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,920
conclude a stronger relation between the number of movies produced and

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,040
cancer incidence in a population to be a causation instead,

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,660
perhaps leading to some serious actions being taken erroneously.

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,320
If the relation between movies produced and cancer is completely spurious, and

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,500
the true cause of the cancer incidence increase is due to

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,470
some completely separate event.

23
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,800
If the results that the analyst found are presented either on potentially wrong

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,720
media, let's say an academic paper, rather than simply on their personal blog or

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,740
maybe in an article, some serious consequences might be

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,810
taken based off of, again, the spurious correlation.

27
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,280
Let's say the doctor sees a paper published based on this connection in relation

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,500
that some analyst found, and then decides to recommend to all of his patients to

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,080
stop watching all movies and TV because it increases cancer incidence.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,580
By misinterpreting a correlation to, in fact,

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,240
be causation could lead to many misleading conclusions, and

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,070
thus, serious consequences that others might take based on those conclusions.
