1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,110
Just to recap and tie in some of the things we've covered earlier in

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,180
this lesson, I would say that this is very much an author driven narrative.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,370
Partly because it's static, but more importantly, I as in author decided to

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,270
make the red circles slightly larger and to represent the home team.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,940
So I dictated what information I wanted to draw attention to,

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,260
which other information may not be as striking.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,630
And even by the simple fact of making the home team red,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,200
and every other team matches blue, as an author,

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,980
I've influenced how a reader might interpret the graphic I've presented them.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,880
And in closing, I just wanted to come back to where we

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,220
started before were even live coding.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,360
We're trying to communicate our insight and our message.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,290
In the case of this chart relating to the globalization of the world, and

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,680
also capitalization of the gains in an effective manner.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,800
And again, just to remind you,

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,810
always be aware of biases in your data, yourself, and your audience.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,400
And always consider how your audience might interpret or

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,710
interact with your visualization.

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,930
And I'll leave you with one last open-ended question.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,140
Have we achieved what we set out to by communicating our message?

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,880
I encourage you to think about and post your thoughts in the forum about,

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,660
what works about this visualization, what could be improved, and

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,200
also whether the next step is an iteration on the scatter plot like this or

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,420
something more drastic where we change.

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,670
The complete form and

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,919
structure as we take one step closer to best communicating our message.
