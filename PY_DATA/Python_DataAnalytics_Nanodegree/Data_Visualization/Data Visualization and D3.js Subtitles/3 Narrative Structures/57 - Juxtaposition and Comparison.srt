00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,130
I want to just take a step back to remind you what direction we're going in,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,710
the iterative process, and what our end goal is.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,560
One of the more common techniques to add context to our graphics and

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,119
data is the use of juxtaposition or comparison.

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,601
In the case of our scatter plot, we want to draw attention to

6
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:25,008
the games involving the home team by making them red and slightly larger so

7
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,279
that someone reading our graphic could compare them to

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,330
the games which don't involve the home country's team.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,540
Doing so leverages some of the theory of pre-attentive processing by drawing

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,900
the reader to those games which do involve the home team so

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,630
that the audience can implicitly compare them to every other game.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,620
Again, reminding you of the message of what we're trying to

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,400
convey is one of globalization and capitalization.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,720
A priori, we may not know what effect making the home games red and

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,030
slightly larger will have, and whether or

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,930
not the comparison it creates helps communicate our message.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,050
So let's go back to our web browser and see what effect this actually had.
