1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,810
So in terms of any other stories or graphics I think this one tells a really

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,510
direct story, it's really clear to get that information out of it.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,510
Are there any examples that you have where, that's not the case,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,980
let's say the data visualization is misleading.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,600
>> Yeah.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,310
Absolutely.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,870
So one repeat offender when it comes to breaking rules of

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,770
data visualization is Fox News.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,110
We'll look here at an example that I typically look at in my workshops.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,450
So, here what we're looking at,

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,726
we have to imagine ourselves back in the fall of 2012.

12
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:35,073
And we're looking forward to 2013 to say what's going to happen if

13
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:36,384
the tax cuts expire?

14
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:40,441
So on the left hand side we have what the top tax rate is now at 35%.

15
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:46,500
On the right hand side what it'll go to as of January 1st at 39.6%.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,970
Do you notice any issues, with this graph?

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,330
>> I should, I guess be worried because there's a big gap difference between

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,130
the two bars.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,990
>> Yeah, your data spidey sense if probably going off here, right?

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,960
Because this increase looks huge.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,810
Why does it look huge?

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,470
>> For me it's the, the length of the bar.

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,360
The one on the right is much bigger than the one on the left.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,020
>> Yeah, and if we look at the details here which are small and

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,800
off to the right, maybe so that we miss them.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,516
It's because our y axis doesn't start at zero.

27
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,426
>> Hm. >> It starts at 34.

28
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:18,714
Which means the way this is plotted, the visual increase between the two is

29
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:23,478
460%, versus the actual increase if we plot this you know, with the bars going

30
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,128
all the way down to where they should be, the increase is something like 13%.

31
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:31,738
So the specific rule that Fox News is breaking here is,

32
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,720
bar charts must have a zero baseline.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,260
When we're looking at bar charts,

34
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,660
what our eyes are doing are comparing the end points of these bars.

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,500
So it's actually really important to have the entire context of the bar there to

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,620
do that.

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,770
In the right way.

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,060
More generally this brings into question sort of ethical concerns, right?

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,270
>> Hm. >> And they're breaking the rule here, also don't lie with data.

40
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,610
So beyond ethical concerns, it's just a really dangerous space to play in,

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,510
because all it takes is that one discerning audience member to say.

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,770
Hey yeah but that y axis doesn't start at zero, and

43
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,340
whatever message you're trying to communicate then gets thrown out the window.

44
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,170
>> Well, I know this was probably true for

45
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,530
bar charts with like the perception that we have here.

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,730
Are there any cases where we don't necessarily have to start the y axis at zero?

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,260
>> Yeah with line charts you can get away with not starting at zero.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,680
You still want to be very careful when doing so.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,380
Because our eyes are comparing the sort of relative points in

50
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,440
space rather than to an axis, the way that they are with bar charts.

51
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,304
In general, you want to

52
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,280
try make it clear to the audience that you're doing that.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,570
And not zoom in so far that you're making minor changes appear to be really big.

54
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,070
Right, so

55
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,640
you want to take the context of what it is you're showing into account there.
