00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,500
Now that you've learned about data types I want you to take a look at

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,340
this image, which is linked in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,450
I've gone ahead and identified the different variables in this visualization,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,320
but what I want you to do is identify it through data types.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,620
For example, is this variable, doctor visits per year, a nominal data type,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,360
an ordered data type or a quantitative data type?

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,870
Choose one of these for each of the variables.
