00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,580
We have just learned about the theory behind what

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,120
makes an effective data visualization.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,610
We saw how color, shape, length and scales, among other visual elements,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,190
can contribute both to the aesthetics of a data visualization,

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,330
as well as how the underlying information and data is communicated.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,490
Now I want to talk about how we might make some of the visualizations we

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,160
have seen and put the theory we talked about into practice.
