Hi. I'm here with Jonathan and Ryan again of Zipfian Academy.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,640
And I want to take a step back before we dive too much into

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,530
detail about data visualization.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,820
I really want to get your guys' insight into sort of the background of

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,700
students and what it takes to be successful in creating data visualizations.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,190
So I guess for you, Jonathan,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,840
what sort of things do you want students to now after their time at Zipfian?

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,530
>> Yeah, it's a great question Chris.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,230
And seeing so many students work on so many projects here at Zipfian coming from

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,040
a diverse set of backgrounds I would say the most common hang up I

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,530
see with students is focusing too much on some complex analysis, or

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,200
optimizing some model without thinking about the larger process as a whole.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,700
And I often like to tell my students your greatest insight is only as good

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,790
as your ability to communicate it.

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,660
So if you spend weeks optimizing a model to be 99.9% accurate,

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,230
but don't think about how someone might use it or derive some value from it,

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,670
it's basically useless.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,290
>> Oh, interesting.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,620
And for you Bryan I guess what sort of things do you think students need to

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,960
know in order to be successful in creating data visualizations?

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,900
>> Yeah I think data visualization is really interesting because it's

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,770
both an art and a science.

23
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,430
So, students not only need to know how to code, to work with the libraries, and

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,560
explore your data, but you also have to have a really good sense of visual

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,110
design and storytelling to craft something that's compelling to the audience.

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,490
We're going to cover both aspects in this course, in order to students to

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,380
think really critically about the visualizations that they create.

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,020
>> Great.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,790
Thanks so much guys.
