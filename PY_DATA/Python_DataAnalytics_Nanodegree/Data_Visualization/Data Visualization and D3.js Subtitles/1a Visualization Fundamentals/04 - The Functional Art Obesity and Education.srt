Before I show you the next part of my interview with Cole,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,110
I'd like you to read about a blog post that we're going to discuss.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,700
You can find a link to that blog post in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,000
This post was shared by Andy Kriebel,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,100
a data visualization guru over at Facebook.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,820
He's got an interesting blog named VizWiz and

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,040
he's also got a really funny quote on his main page.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,470
We'll talk more about why this is true towards the end of the course, but

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,940
I just wanted to show you this humorous quote.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,390
For now, what I would like you to do,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,180
is to read through each of these tabs by clicking on the Next button.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,820
In each of these panels, Alberto Cairo is going to walk you

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,540
through the design process for creating data visualizations.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,450
He lays out how he created the graphic for the cover of his book.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,280
In the final tab, you'll actually get to see that graphic, and

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,230
I really want you to take some time to play around with the final graphic that

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,120
he arrives at, and then, answer these next questions.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,950
What's the average percentage of obese people in all the states?

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,880
Which state has the largest percentage of its population that

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,270
obtained a Bachelor's degree or more?

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,280
Enter that two letter state abbreviation here.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,210
And then finally, do more states have a majority of obese people or

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,540
educated people?

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,450
Choose one of these.
