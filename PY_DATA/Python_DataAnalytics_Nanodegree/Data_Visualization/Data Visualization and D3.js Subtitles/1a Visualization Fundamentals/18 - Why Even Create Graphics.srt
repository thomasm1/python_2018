Thanks Ryan.

00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,810
For exploratory analysis like these plots, we can clearly see patterns or

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,062
deviations in the data that we might miss from a table or summary statistics.

4
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,290
But there's still an even more important reason for

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,880
creating graphics like these in the first place.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,166
The key lies in the immense power of our visual processing system.

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,680
Danish physicist Tor Norretrander converted the bandwidth of

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,230
our senses to computer terms to help us understand this power.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,510
In this visualization,

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,940
I can see that sight takes up the majority of the frame here.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,590
In fact, it's been said that sight can process information up to the speed of

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,710
computer networks, or an Ethernet cable.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,930
Sense of taste has the bandwidth of a calculator.

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,900
And the small white box at the corner of this frame is only 0.7% of the area,

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,600
and it's what we are aware of when all this processing is happening.
