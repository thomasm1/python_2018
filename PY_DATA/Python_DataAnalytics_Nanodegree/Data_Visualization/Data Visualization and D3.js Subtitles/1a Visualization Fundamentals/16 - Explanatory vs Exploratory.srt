00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,890
Now you might be asking yourself what's the difference between something like

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,210
exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,990
In the previous diagram I drew a pretty big distinction between the two, but

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,730
to students new to visualization, they can often seem very similar.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,890
Chris, how would you describe the difference between EDA and

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,760
something like data visualization?

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,660
>> Yeah I think of it as the difference between notes and lecture.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,720
It is a conversation between yourself and the data.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,830
While data visualization is a conversation between data and your audience.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,350
>> Yeah, I think Kathy O'Neil puts it

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,160
really well in her book Doing Data Science.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,310
She says that EDA is what happens between you and

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,429
your data when you're not trying to do prove anything to anyone yet.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,510
When I get a piece of data,

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,190
the first thing I do is make some basic plots, scatter plots, histograms and

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,310
things like that, and it's important for a variety of reasons.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,940
Let's look at one now.
