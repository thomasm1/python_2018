1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,240
In trying to define data visualization,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,990
I consulted some experts to learn more about the field.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,820
Here's what they had to say.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,550
Hi everyone.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,659
I'm here with Scott Murray.

6
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:10,590
Scott, could you introduce yourself?

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,300
>> Sure.

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,170
I'm an assistant professor here at the University of San Francisco where I

9
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,790
teach in the design program.

10
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,490
I teach some of our intro classes, but

11
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,360
I also teach interaction design and information visualization.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,020
And I'm author of the book Interactive Data Visualization for

13
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,940
the Web An Introduction to Designing with D3.

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,970
>> So, Scott, what is data visualization?

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,270
>> Well there's obviously a lot of different possible answers to that.

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,811
But I like to think about data visualization as mapping.

17
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:41,290
Not sort of making geographic maps, like traditionally how we think about maps.

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,040
But mapping values to visuals.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,300
So teach a class on information visualization, it's,

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,060
it's sort of about information broadly, but when we're talking about data

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,010
visualization, I think of data as being kind of structured information.

22
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,200
So if you have a spreadsheet, you have rows and

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,210
columns, you have sort of information that's not just loosey goosey, but

24
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,830
it's organized in some sort of structured way.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,670
So the visualization part is taking that data and figuring out ways to

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,310
translate that into visuals that are more readily understood.

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,270
So instead of reading these columns of numbers, we can look at you know,

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,651
these pictures of bars, or lines, or shapes, or whatever, different colors.

29
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,980
>> Okay, great.

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,690
Hi everyone.

31
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,370
I'm here with Cole Nussbaumer, who's a blogger with storytelling with data.

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,008
She's here to share some insights about data visualization, and

33
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,330
share some tips about how you can get started in the field.

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,810
So Cole, first tell us, what is data visualization?

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,680
>> So for me data visualization is about turning numbers into pictures and

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,780
into stories.

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,080
There's something about making data visual that allows us to explore and

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,800
understand the data in a different way.

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,940
Our visual system is actually really fast at processing information.

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,877
So good data visualization can lend itself to this sort of

41
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,855
ha moment of understanding.

42
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:01,355
>> Great.
