00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,970
The last feature of this visualization I want to cover is animation.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,310
Animation isn't technically a visual encoding, but

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,550
you can think of it as encoding some information, or rather,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,790
change of information in a certain sort of way.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,450
As we can see here,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,360
the animation really highlights how drastically different the Facebook IPO

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,580
was in value compared to the history of IPOs that came before it.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,729
Not only does the animation convey some of the process the RS went through

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,370
in creating this visualization, such as discovering that the Facebook IPO was so

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,630
drastically greater than all the other IPOs.

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,380
Or the fact that using different scaling, in this case logarithmic,

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,450
makes the graphic much more interpretable, but also gets across

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,240
some of the relative change of the companies in the years after they've IPOed.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,435
While you might be able to encode this sort of information, such as how much

15
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:07,560
a company's value has changed after its IPO, in another dimension of visual

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,310
encoding, let's say the z axis, it is much easier, and I think

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,580
much more effective, to communicate that information through the animation.
