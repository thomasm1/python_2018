1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,270
Each of these stages happens to map very nicely to the Dat C data science track.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,210
What the first stage is concerned with,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,910
you will encounter in the data wrangling class with MongoDB.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,200
The second stage,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,410
is often the domain of what people consider exploratory data analysis.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,880
Which you'll encounter in the data analysis with our class, but other classes

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,460
such as modeling, statistics, and machine learning also apply to this stage.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,220
And the last two stages are what we will encounter in this data

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,800
visualization class.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,990
Lessons one and two will focus on data visualization theory where you'll

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,460
learn how best to visually represent your data.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,650
And how to sketch or prototype a visualization to arrive at a final design.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,760
And finally, in lessons three and

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,240
lesson four we will learn how to construct narratives around your data and

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,540
leverage interaction to create engaging experiences for our audience and reader.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,930
And while this diagram might be biased towards the visualization process,

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,490
since Ben Fry got his PhD from the Aesthetics & Computation Group at

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,570
MIT's Media Lab, I don't mind since that's what this class will focus on.
