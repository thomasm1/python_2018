1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,280
Country was encoded by color hue.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,280
Game win or losses was encoded by position y or orientation.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,060
Scoring margin was encoded by position Y or length.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,910
World Cup winners were indicated by shape, and time was encoded by position X.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,560
Let's see these on the graphic.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,050
We can see the country is encoded by the color of the bars, or

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,630
really each country has its own panel of data.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,380
So, Germany would be red, Brazil would be green, Argentina blue and

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,380
The Netherlands orange.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,020
Each of these bars represents an individual game and

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,680
the scoring margin for that game.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,590
So, whether or not a game was a win or

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,010
loss depends on the Y position, or the orientation of the bar.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,120
Bars that point upwards indicate wins for

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,970
Germany, while bars that point downward indicate losses for Germany.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,780
The actual scoring margin for each game is the length of the bar.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,940
In this case it looks like about positive 3.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,880
We also accepted position Y since the scoring margin could be positive upward,

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,150
or downward negative.

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,860
Time is encoded horizontally along the x-axis for each of our small multiples.

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,295
And then finally, whether or not a country was a World Cup winner is encoded

22
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:13,265
by shape or a star, which we see for Germany in 1954, 1974 and 1990.

23
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,350
Now I think this visualization is quite successful.

24
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,360
And what's incredible is that there's even more going on in it,

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,330
such as the annotations that you see here, and

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,440
the alternation between this white and light tan background encoding the years.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,320
If you find other things that you like about this visualization,

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,710
share it on the discussion threads.
