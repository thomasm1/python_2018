00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:02,420
It's always important to plot your data.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,350
Let's go through an example y.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,300
I've got here eleven data points, which I've plotted on the right.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,830
We might want to compute some summary statistics about this data set.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,870
Such as its mean, variance, correlation coefficient, and line of best fit.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,322
Now suppose I give you three more data sets with exactly the same

7
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,760
summary statistics, like this.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,747
You'd expect that since these data sets have the same mean,

9
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:28,918
variance, correlation coefficient, and

10
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:32,439
line of best fit, that they look very similar when visualized.

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,820
Let's have a look now.

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,630
How similar are these data sets?

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,240
Not very.

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,510
We can see here the effect of curvature and

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,230
outliers have drastically thrown off our summary statistics.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,830
This is something called Anscombe's quartet.

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,260
And demonstrates how important it is to always plot your data,

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,128
rather than relying on summary statistics alone.

19
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:56,560
Tools like matplotlib in Python or ggplot in R are great ways to

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,580
plot your data visually, allowing you to pick out visual patterns, trends, and

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,450
outliers during your analysis.

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,950
Hopefully, this example has shown you the power of data visualization and

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,190
why you should use it every day.
