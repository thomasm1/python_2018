00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,750
Now that you've got a handle on visual encodings and

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,310
data types, we'd like you to go find your own visualization to decompose it.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,410
Here's what I mean.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,840
This graph shows medals won by each country during the Summer Olympics.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,420
This graphic is actually a cartogram, where the geography, or

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,720
the area of each country, has been distorted by the number of medals won.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,034
Larger bubbles indicate a country that's won many medals, like Russia and

8
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:28,270
China, while smaller countries have won fewer medals, such as Singapore.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,509
For whatever data visualization that you find, I'd like you to indicate what

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,020
are the variables, what are the data types, what are their visual encodings and

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,310
to what extent are those encodings effective?

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,680
You can find eight examples from the link in the instruction notes.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,620
But be sure to find a different graphic than the ones provided here.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,960
We want you to go two steps further, though.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,810
The examples here only describe the encodings for the variables.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,720
Be sure you also identify the data types and

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,180
describe the effectiveness of the visual encodings.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,950
Do you think the display analogs aid in the interpretation of the visualization,

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,020
or do you think they distract from the viz?

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,970
So take some time to find a visualization and answer these questions.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,250
Once you've posted a link or image of the viz with your response in

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,900
the discussion thread, check this box to continue.
