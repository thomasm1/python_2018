1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,570
To display a map in D3 you do not theoretically have to

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,380
do anything much different from when we displayed points in a scatterplot.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,000
We simply need to convert from some data representation to a screen

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,250
representation, or rather go from the domain of

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,000
our data to some range of pixels to draw on the web page.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,230
In the scatter plot we went from years, represented as a date, and

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,480
attendance, represented as floats, to pixel values.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,490
Or rather, x coordinate and y coordinate on our chart.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,420
And for our map, we do exactly the same thing except this time we're

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,710
going from geographic coordinates to an associated pixel range.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,200
Or more specifically, we're going from a latitude and

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,530
a longitude coordinate to pixel values.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,100
The latitude actually corresponds to the Y coordinate, and

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,980
the longitude corresponds to the X coordinate.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,720
In the scatterplot we used D3's scale to go

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,959
from our data domain to our pixel range.

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,110
And in a very analogous way.

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,320
To convert our geographic coordinates to a pixel range we have

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,800
to use a projection, or more specifically in our case,

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,680
we'll be using the Mercator projection.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,845
But let's take a second now and really understand what a projection is.

22
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:27,490
Coordinate data that represents points on a sphere, or our case the globe,

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,480
actually encodes information in three dimensions, and since the Earth,

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,220
being a three dimensional object or a sphere, there is no perfect way to display

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,320
it on two-dimensional surface, such as a computer screen or a piece of paper.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,540
One approach that you could take, and

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,760
is often used out there, is to simply render a globe or

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,780
a three-dimensional object in a webpage using three-dimensional graphics,

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,810
but this has its own set of complexities in addition to the fact.

30
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,150
You can usually only see one face of the globe at a time.

31
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,840
The other, much more common approach is to use a projection,

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,000
which actually has been done for centuries to draw maps on parchment or canvas.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,468
The act of projection can be thought of as cutting the surface off of a three

34
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:24,730
dimensional object, or globe, and trying to flatten it out into two dimensions.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,540
And there's never a perfect way to present something in greater dimensions in

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,060
a lower dimension without some loss of information or distortion.

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,530
So when you're going from a three dimensional globe to a two dimensional map

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,160
the question then becomes, where do we distort our map?

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,410
And what's often done depends on the region of geographic interest.

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,810
If you're only looking at countries on the equator,

41
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,030
you want to try to best preserve the spatial representation around the equator.

42
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,990
And you might be willing to distort near the poles.

43
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,300
And the Mercator projection does just that.

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,870
It decides to distort the least populated regions.

45
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,520
More simply, regions near the poles.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,780
To imagine this projection, think of trying to flatten this globe out.

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,520
And in order to get a square you stretch the areas near the poles so

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,420
that the Earth can be represented by a rectangle.

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,540
Which also has the effect of straightening out the latitude and longitude lines.

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,370
So the Mercator projection sacrifices the poles to preserve countries and

51
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,590
areas closer to the equator which have a much more

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,150
accurate representation in two dimensions.
