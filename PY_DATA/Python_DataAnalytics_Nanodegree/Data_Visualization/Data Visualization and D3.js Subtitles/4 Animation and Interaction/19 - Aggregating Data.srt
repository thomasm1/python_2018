1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,820
To get the sum of the attendances, we'll be using the d3 sum method, which takes

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,800
both some array or less like object, in our case leaves, and an accessor

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,270
function that defines what to actually sum, in our case the attendance.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,060
Hopefully, you're starting to see a pattern here and even for

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,370
something like a sum.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,440
D3 defines it over some collection of data.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,090
In this case, leaves with some accessor function

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,860
to customize the behavior of it.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,600
In this case, every element of leaves gets passed to the accessor callback as d.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,070
And whatever we return from the successor callback, d3 adds up and

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,970
returns from the sum.
