If we reload the page,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,939
we can see here that we have a list of buttons with an orange background

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,110
containing all the years of the World Cup, starting with 1930 and going to 2014.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,750
Now this looks great, but I still want to be able to animate through

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,908
all the years before a user will select and possibly interrupt the animation.

6
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:29,710
To do this, I need to make sure that the animation finishes before I append

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,260
these elements, and before I start adding some interaction to these buttons.
