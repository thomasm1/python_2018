1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,150
Now there's a wealth of resources online and

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,080
classes you could take to learn more about these things,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,110
many of which you can find in the resources section of this course.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,450
But my best advice to learning more when I encourage all of you to do this,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,530
is to simply start creating your own visualizations, your own graphics and

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,960
your own projects, and put them online for others to see,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,120
either in the form of this course, or on a personal blog or public site.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,290
And with that, I'll bid you farewell.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,740
I hope to see some of your awesome projects for

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,830
this course and things you create outside this course.
