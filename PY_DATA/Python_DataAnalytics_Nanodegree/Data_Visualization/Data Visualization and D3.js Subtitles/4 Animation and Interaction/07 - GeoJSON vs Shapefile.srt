Two benefits the GeoJSON has over shape files is that it is human readable and

00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,650
inspectable, and

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,790
since it's valid JSON it can be parsed by most programming languages.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,070
One downside of GeoJSON however that achieved these two

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,570
things it's often more verbose, resulting in a larger files size.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,970
And neither GeoJSON or shape files actually can encode topographic information.
