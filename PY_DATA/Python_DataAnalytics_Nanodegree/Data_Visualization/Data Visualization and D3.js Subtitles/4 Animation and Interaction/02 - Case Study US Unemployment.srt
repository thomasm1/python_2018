1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,860
What's an example of an interactive graphic that you've seen and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,550
that tells a really compelling story?

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,920
>> One of my all time favorites is by Amanda Cox, Sean Carter, and

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,180
Kevin Quealy of the New York Times.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,230
I'll pull it up over here.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,620
It's actually from 2009,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,500
so you know, it seems like a long time ago, at this point.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,810
But it's an unemployment graphic.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,910
I think people just talk about it as the unemployment graphic.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,630
But it's called The Jobless Rate for People Like You.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,650
Well as, as you can see.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,770
So it's, it's really interesting.

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,030
First of all it starts out giving you this line.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,140
So we can see over time from January 2007 to September 2009.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,320
We can see kind of okay the jobless rate has gone up.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,520
Unemployment has gone up.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,110
For all men and women overall.

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,630
Right.

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,820
But what's really beautiful and

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,350
compelling about this is that you can sort of you know,

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,220
as soon as you mouse over this piece you know, you can interact with it,

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,040
and you can start seeing like these different categories or groupings of people.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,750
And you can use these toggles up here.

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,480
So I guess, okay well.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,650
You know, I'm interested in white women in this age group who, you know,

26
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,680
are college graduates.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,718
So we can say, well, for that group, it's like, okay, the,

28
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,450
the employment rate is really pretty low, 3.6%.

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,640
But we could change.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,770
Maybe we could say Hispanic men who are younger, for example.

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,500
We can see the fluctuations over time for that group, and see that they,

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,370
how much higher unemployment rate, at least as of 2009, right.

33
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,650
So I think this is, this is really let's see.

34
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,550
If we click into some of these I think this rescales to, yeah, so You know,

35
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,410
unfortunately, you can see who has the highest unemployment rate.

36
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,610
Like it's so high that we have to rescale the chart, right?

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,490
It's a black man, 15 to 24 without a high school degree.

38
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,180
So, and it's really compelling because you can get a sense of the,

39
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,290
kind of massive inequalities here?

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,690
But also, you know, the graphic works.

41
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,010
Just on its own.

42
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,670
Like, even if it weren't interactive,

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,210
this is the kind of thing you could see published in the paper.

44
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,538
Like a static version, right?

45
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,350
And so you could say,

46
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,330
okay, well, I can see, I can see the unemployment is going up.

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,740
But as soon as you have a graphic and you can kind of,

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,610
you know, find yourself inside that graphic, I think it makes it really.

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,060
Really compelling.

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,370
And just by tapping in a couple different categories and say, oh wow,

51
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm in this group.

52
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,870
This represents me and now I can see how I compare to the average and

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,799
how I can compare to everybody else.
