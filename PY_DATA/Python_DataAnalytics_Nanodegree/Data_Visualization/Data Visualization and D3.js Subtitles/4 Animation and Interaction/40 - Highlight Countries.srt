00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,240
If we run update here with the year 1969,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,940
you can see that every circle for the World Cup has disappeared.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,340
I'll close the web console so we can be extra sure, and while it may be hard to

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,430
see for yourself, trust me there are no more circles on the page.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,680
So what's happened is that the filtered selection that we've made for

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,220
the year 1969, was simply empty.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,500
So when we made an exit selection,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,240
it contained every circle those on the page and we removed all of them.
