00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,150
As you can see here, after I've created or appended this div element to contain

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,640
all my buttons, I'm simply selecting all the divs in that parent div,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,750
binding data corresponding to all the years, making an enter selection which

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,570
will grab me all the elements that are currently not yet on the page.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,600
Which in this case is going to be all of them since we are near the top of our

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,960
file, and append div that has text equal to the data itself.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,950
And as you can see here, I've moved the code that we wrote earlier up to

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,230
the top of the file to find all the years in which there was a World Cup.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,920
So that for the buttons I don't have to hand code every year one at a time.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
I can simply bind the years array to my div elements.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,850
I've also added some CSS styling above to make the buttons somewhat pleasing.
