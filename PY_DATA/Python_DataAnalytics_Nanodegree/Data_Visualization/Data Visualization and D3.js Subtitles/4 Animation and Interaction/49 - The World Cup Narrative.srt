00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,670
The story I hope to tell, by leveraging the negative space, is that as

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,650
time's gone on, what started as a small, somewhat local tournament or event,

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,100
has evolved into a global phenomena, both for the countries participating and

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,250
the home countries in terms of how much visitors they're looking to attract.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,720
Notice in the early years when there may not have been such good transportation,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,980
especially across the Atlantic, the participating countries were often

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,320
somewhat local to the game and where it's being held.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,520
But as time's gone on,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,820
we can see that more countries from across the globe are participating.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,860
And the last point I'd want to draw your attention to before we leave,

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,450
is that in the beginning, and still somewhat recently, Europe and

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,150
South America often dominate participation in the game and dominate who hosts.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,470
Well that concludes our map, so let's go and

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,750
try to add some additional features to make it more interactive.
