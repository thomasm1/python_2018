1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,350
We can make sure this will never happen simply by sorting our data,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,500
using the built in JavaScript.sort function to find on all arrays, and

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,950
make sure that our nested data set is in the correct order before we bind it

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,030
in our data binding function.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,030
To sort our data, the elements I've nested get passed to

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,120
our call back accessor function two at a time, a and b.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,330
And based on the return value from this function,

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,299
either a gets placed before b or b gets placed before a.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,740
If the return value is less than zero, a gets placed first or

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,530
rather, the first argument to the function.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,650
If the return value is greater than zero, b gets placed first.

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,890
Or rather, the second argument to the function gets placed first.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,550
And if what gets returned is zero then there's no change.

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,880
Simply leave a and b in the order that they originally were in.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,860
In our case, if the attendance of b is greater than the attendance of a,

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,830
the return value will be positive and b will get placed first.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,730
Thus having the effect of drawing the larger attendances first.

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,410
If a happens to have a larger attendance.

19
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,740
Then b, the return value will be negative.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,810
In this case, a will get placed first.

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,080
And again, this is correct since a would have the larger attendance.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,890
And now that our map is on a take shape,

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,110
we have geographies of countries plotted as well as data,

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,490
we can begin adding animation to encode the passage of time.
