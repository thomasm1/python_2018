1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,870
And here's a map in addition to showing the globe has plotted

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,720
circles on the map to show the relative distortion at different latitudes.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,480
As you can see here, as you go south and north, the distortion increases.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,390
And it's a bit subtle, but the distortion going from

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,330
circle one to two is much less than going from two to three.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,770
So there's not equal distortion going from the equator, North.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,360
But it does it's best as close to the equator as it can, to preserve area.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,700
And once you get far, far North.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,810
The Mercator projection is much more lenient in its distortions.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,680
One thing of note is that the Mercator projection actually preserves area

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,870
across a latitude line.

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,460
So even if you are very North, going across the same latitude line,

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,190
all the circles are equally as distorted.

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,210
If you've ever wondered why Alaska looks about as big as

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,940
the entire United States, and Greenland looks bigger than Africa,

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,000
it's simply because the Mercator projection vastly distorts countries or area so

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,150
far North and South of the equator, and is often one of the most ubiquitous map

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,260
projections you see out there, regardless of this distortion effect.

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,380
But for our purposes, we're interested in countries in the middle region.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,630
One, because they're the participating countries in the World Cup and

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,410
most frequently participating and two, the locations near the center of

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,660
the map are the ones where the World Cup's actually been held.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,040
So let's return to our code and start drawing.
