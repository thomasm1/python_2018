1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,160
Remember, our update function takes a single year as an argument, and

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,220
with this year, we have to filter our data.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,660
In this case, we'll actually be filtering our nested object.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,500
Remember, when we grouped our data by year,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,050
the nested object had its key property set to the year.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,660
And then our filter function, all we need to do is strip out the key and

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,150
compare it to the year we want to filter by.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,740
In this case, the nested object actually has its keys as strings,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,870
so we first need to convert the string back into a date, pull the year out, and

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,310
compare it to the year passed to our update function.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,460
And the filter function works just like a map except for

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,340
instead of returning every element of the array it's called on,

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,360
it only returns ones where, in our accessor function, we return true.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,380
In this case, true will only be returned for the elements d,

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,940
where the key is equal to the year passed to our update function.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,860
And now that we have the correct data filtered,

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,420
we can begin updating our map and the circles drawn.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,930
To do this, we'll use data binding and

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,890
the special enter and exit selection that we covered in the last lesson.
