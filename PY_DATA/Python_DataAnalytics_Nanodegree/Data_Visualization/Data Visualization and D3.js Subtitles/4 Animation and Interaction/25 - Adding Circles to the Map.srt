1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,410
Since we already computed the center x and center y pixel.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,260
in our nested object to set the center x and

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,160
center y of our circles we simply need to access that value.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,059
In this case nested in d.values with key x.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,990
And nested in d under .values at

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,976
key y to determine where on our map to place the circles.

7
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:28,630
And for simplicity's sake, to verify that the location of the circle is correct,

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,120
we will plot the circles with a constant radius of five to start
