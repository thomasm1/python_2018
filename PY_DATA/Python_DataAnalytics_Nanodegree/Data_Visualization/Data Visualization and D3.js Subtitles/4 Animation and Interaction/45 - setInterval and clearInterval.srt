1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,760
And now that we have our years in addition to our update function,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,630
let's put them together in setInterval.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,380
The syntax for

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,910
setInterval is that the first argument it expects is a function to run.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,590
And the second argument is the number of milliseconds for

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the interval to run at.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,910
So for this example we'll run this anonymous function every second or

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,500
every 1,000 milliseconds starting one second from when set interval gets called.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,630
And the way to stop an interval, so it doesn't go on forever, is to remember in

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,310
a variable, what interval you set, and inside our function for the interval.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,280
We need to put our code that runs the update function and

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,460
pass it one year at a time.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,700
In our code here, we're creating an index, so we know which year we're at.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,105
Inside our function is called at the specified setInterval of

15
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:54,932
1,000 milliseconds.

16
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:59,080
We're running our update function with the specified index

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,340
to get the correct year from our years array and

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,310
running update with that year incrementing the index by 1.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,430
And then if the index happens to be greater than then number of

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,390
elements in our years array, meaning we've going to through every year,

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,790
past the year interval, the JavaScript function clearInterval.

22
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,680
ClearInterval is simply a built in JavaScript function,

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,750
that takes as a single argument, an interval variable created with setInterval.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,220
And stops it so that we don't run for

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,500
ever, update after update of the World Cup map.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,780
To make this a little bit more clear, calling setInterval,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,150
it returns an interval object which we're remembering in our year_interval

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,780
variable which we then are going to pass to clearInterval to stop or

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,140
function from getting called every 1,000 milliseconds.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,910
And now let's save our file and go back to our browser and

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,100
see how our map animates.
