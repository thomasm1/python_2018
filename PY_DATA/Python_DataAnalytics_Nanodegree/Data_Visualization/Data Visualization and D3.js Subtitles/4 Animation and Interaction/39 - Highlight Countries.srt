1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,750
Now that we have a better handle on what these selections actually represent,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,730
let's go back to our circles.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,540
Get the exit selection on it.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,620
Again, which corresponds to every circle except year 1930.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,970
And call the D3 function remove.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,670
So this has the effect of finding every element on the page

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,890
through the exit selection that doesn't belong there and simply removing them.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,210
If we run this code and look at our map, how it's been updated, it's hard to

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,490
see since the attendance was so small, but there's a single dot remaining here.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,420
I'll try to zoom in.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,640
And you can see here, it corresponds to the 1930 games.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,370
So our exit and remove have worked correctly.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,430
Going back to our text editor,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,000
now that we've removed every element that doesn't belong there.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,590
Let us add or update any element that should change on the page.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,270
As you can see here much of the code is identical to the code that drew

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,470
our initial circles and this is very intentional because we

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,620
want all the circles representing the attendance of games to look similarly.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,180
As you can see here for the circles new data bound,

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,980
which is all the circles on the page, bound to new data filtered.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,550
And our key function we take the enter selection, so anything that's not

22
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,570
currently on the page we want to append a circle to the page,

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,380
and then set all of the same properties.

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,670
Notice here that I didn't include any of the calls to .style, and

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,030
I've abstracted all the styles of circles up into CSS in the head

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,670
of the page rather than duplicate a lot of

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,300
the same code to change the styling on the circles as well.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,180
It's cleaner and easier if we're going to be adding and

29
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,500
removing a bunch of circles on the page to not have to specify every time that

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,390
we want the same styles that every other circle had.

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,150
So now let's put all the code together that we both run in the console and

32
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,660
that I've shown here, to first remove the circles that don't belong there and

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,700
then add any circles that need to be there.

34
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,930
As you can see here, we're simply removing any circles in the exit selection and

35
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,360
appending any circles in the enter selection.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,430
Let's go back to our console and just test that this circle adding and

37
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,080
removing works as we expect.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,650
And here we've stopped right before we called the update function.

39
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,200
So let's see what happens if we call update with the year 1930.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,370
As expected, every circle disappeared except for

41
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,254
the tiny, tiny circle representing the year 1930.

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,080
Let's try to show the most recent World Cup in Brazil, passing update of 2014.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,910
As you can see here, the 1930 World Cup was removed and

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,380
we've added the Brazil World Cup.

45
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,870
So it appears that our update function is working correctly.

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,880
GIven what I've shown you, what do you think happens if we try to update a year

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,719
in which there were no World Cup, for example the year 1969?
