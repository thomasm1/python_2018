1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,550
Since we have all the coordinates of the games in an array,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,590
we can now use D3's mean function to compute the average.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,390
The D3 mean function, just like everything else we've been seeing,

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,310
follows the exact same pattern where we pass it some array, and

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,850
some callback function, which defines the operation we want to perform.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,860
In this case every element of coordinates gets passed to our callback function,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,630
and whatever we return from this callback function gets averaged by the D3

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,800
mean function and stored as a single value.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,420
In our case, in center_x.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,510
And remember the coordinates array represents the X and Y coordinates.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,730
Return from the projection function,

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,320
which gets stored in an array where the first element represents the x value and

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,060
the second element represents the y value.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,955
So our coordinates array is simply a bunch of

15
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,020
x,y pairs representing the pixel values.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,750
Where each game occurred.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,760
And by summing and then dividing by the total number of all the x values,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,680
we simply get the mean, which gets stored in center_x.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,460
We can do exactly the same to find out the center_y pixel value,

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,850
to then return from our rollup function.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,140
So we know the attendance to plot.

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,820
And the x and y, to actually plot it out.
