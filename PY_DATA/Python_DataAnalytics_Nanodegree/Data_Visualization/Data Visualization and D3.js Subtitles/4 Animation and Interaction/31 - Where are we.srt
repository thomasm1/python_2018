1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,570
We now have some context around how the location of

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,040
a World Cup affected its attendance, but since we overlaid circles for

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,500
all the years at once, the context of time has gotten lost.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,540
Or rather, we have sacrificed time for space, or geography in this case.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,550
As we saw with our previous plots and charts, there's quite a big dependence of

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,530
the total attendance of a World Cup with the year it was held, with the trend

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,450
being as time went on, World Cup attendance has steadily increased.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,940
One way to get the best of both worlds, geography and

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,700
time, is to leverage animation to encode the passage of time.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,510
Remember previously that we mentioned animation can be thought of something

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,020
of another visual encoding that helps convey the change of some data over time.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,390
I wanted to take a step back also so

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,070
that we can remember where we are in the process.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,820
We will be creating a drill down story following the martini glass narrative

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,050
structure, but

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,090
currently we only have a static map that represents the base of our glass.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,950
While this is a great foundation and starting point for

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,820
what we will be building, we still need to construct the stem of our glass,

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,990
as well as the mouth of our glass.

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,610
We will now begin building up the stem of our glass,

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,080
through an author driven narrative with animation.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,980
And we will finish the mouth of our glass,

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,570
with a reader driven narrative, enabled through interaction, and

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,470
remember, we're at our starting point with our base map.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,790
We'll be narrowly guiding the reader with our author driven narrative, and

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,400
then allow them to open up and

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,780
explore their own narrative through interaction in the mouth of the glass
