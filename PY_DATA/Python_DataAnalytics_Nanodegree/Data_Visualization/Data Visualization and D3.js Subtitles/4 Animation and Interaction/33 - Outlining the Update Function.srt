00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,480
I have scaffolded an empty function here called update,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,560
which takes as a single argument the year which we elect to update the map with.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,240
In order to update our map for a single year,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,470
we need to perform the following steps.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,090
First, we will be filtering our data for

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,620
the given year that we pass to our update function.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,040
And once we filter our data we need to remove any elements on our

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,320
map which no longer belong there.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,369
And the last piece of our update function is to add any new elements on

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,010
the page that weren't already on their before the update.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,150
In D3 we'll be filtering our data with its built in filter function,

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,400
then select the given year we want to plot.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,580
To find any elements to remove, we'll be using the special exit selection

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,770
after the data bind, and to add any new elements for a given year.

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,760
We'll use the familiar enter selection and

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,260
the last bit that we haven't talked about yet.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,570
But an additional feature I want to add is to only show

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,500
the countries that are participating in the World Cup for the given year.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,090
Now let's see what all of these functions might look like in d3.
