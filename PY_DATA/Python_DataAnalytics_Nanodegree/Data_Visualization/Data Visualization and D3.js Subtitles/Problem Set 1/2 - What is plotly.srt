1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm here with Matt from Matt it's so good to have you here.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,780
>> It's great to be here.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,860
You know I I came here to two things.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,605
Chew bubble gum and talk about graphing and I'm all out of bubble gum.

5
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,490
[LAUGH] So, excited to be here.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,730
>> Great so tell us, what is >> So we're a graphic and analytics platform and

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,390
the idea behind it has been that we want really two things.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,500
One is for anyone at any level of tech, technical sophistication to be

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,800
able to make a really pretty interactive and collaborative graph.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,230
So in the same way that you might make graphs, you know,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,910
with Google Docs, or you know, editing documents with Google docs,

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,040
we want people to be able to edit and analyze data and make graphs there online.

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,920
And we'd like that to be something that's useful for high schoolers and

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,120
then also all the way up to folks who are working on technical and

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,690
sophisticated projects that we have corporations and

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,580
folks at the Washington Post who are using it too.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,330
So first part is anyone at any level making and sharing graphs.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,690
And then the second part is being able to have it be a hub for your data and

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,790
your graphs and your code and your collaboration.

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,710
So typically when you make a graph, you have some data and then you analyze it,

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,430
and then you use either code or maybe a program like Excel or

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,130
Tableau to make your graph.

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,560
And then you email about it.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,411
So you have to put all of those things into an email or into you know,

25
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:25,460
shared folder.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,260
And then other people kind of have to look at it locally and

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,270
check out the data themselves.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,055
But for us we've tried to make it so, that all of that happens off code,

29
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:37,710
graph, data, and collaboration all in one place.

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,440
And it happens between languages.

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,610
So you can add a graph with any language or just a web app.
