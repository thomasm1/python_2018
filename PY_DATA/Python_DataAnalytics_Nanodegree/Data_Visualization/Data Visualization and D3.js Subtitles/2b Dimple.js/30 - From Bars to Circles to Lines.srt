1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,859
And if we reload the page, you can see

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,029
here that the bars have been converted into circles, and

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,730
the axes remain the same, in this case, years, with the label every four years.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,680
And the y axis represents attendance in millions.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,490
And with our scatter plot if we hover we still have the interactive features,

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,760
but this time there's both a horizontal and a vertical guideline to animate out.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,348
My ideal choice of chart type in this case is a line plot.

8
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,980
Since the x-axis represents time and

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,450
has a natural sequence to it, for any time series data a point at time

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,160
t on the x-axis somewhat depends on the time that just came before it.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,356
In this example, 1948 somewhat depends on 1947, which depends on 1946.

12
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:56,414
And this natural ordering from one year to the next or

13
00:00:56,414 --> 00:01:01,240
from one data point to the next, represents something of a transition.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,350
And the line plot really evokes this interpretation by linking each data

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,610
point from one to the next with a graphical element.

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,050
In this case a line or a path between the two.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,020
If we go back to our editor.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,040
Remember, we can change what type of plot we're making, or

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
chart, by simply changing what we pass to add series.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,970
In this case, let's change scatter to line, save our file, and

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,370
go back to our browser.

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,980
If we refresh the page, we can see here.

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,420
Every dot has disappeared and instead we have a line representing the trend.

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,660
But one slight formatting quirk of this line plot is

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,370
that we no longer know how many data points we actually have.

26
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,480
Especially if dimple didn't provide us with hover interaction.

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,480
We wouldn't really know which years and

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,100
how much attendance in those years is represented in our data.

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,680
And without the hover interaction it would actually be impossible to know

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,430
that a World Cup didn't happen in the year 1942, in the year 1946.

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,419
Quick fix for this is to actually combine a line plot and

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,440
a scatter plot to get the best of both charts and almost none of the down sides.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,870
And dimple again, being the flexible and powerful library that it is,

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,960
to achieve this effect we simply just need to add another series.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,980
In this case, with a line and our scatter.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,700
And to draw them on the same set of x and y axes.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,320
Going back to the browser, now we have both the line showing the trend over

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,530
the years, and the circles to show us which years games actually happened in,

39
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,160
and what the precise attendance was for those years.

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,410
And with our scatter dots we can now see that there were no games

41
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,020
between 1938 and 1950, or rather, that the 1942 and 1946 games were skipped.
