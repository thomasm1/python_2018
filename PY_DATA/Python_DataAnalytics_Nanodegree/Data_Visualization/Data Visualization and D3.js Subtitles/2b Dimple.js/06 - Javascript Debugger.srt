1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,940
For this live coding session, I want to make it interactive.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,200
And I'll actually be working from Chrome's debugger and JavaScript console,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,810
once the AJAX request has finished, and my data has been loaded.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,870
To do this, I can put a debugger statement inside the draw a callback function.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,130
To make sure that the AJAX request has completed,

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,930
and that my data has been passed to the function.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,540
You can set up any JavaScript debugger,

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,890
by the keyword debugger, and end the line with a semicolon.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,490
When Chrome loads the page,

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:42,790
it'll first call our d3.tsv function to load world_cup.tsv.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,420
Once the AJAX request has returned, it

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,900
will pass the data file in a JavaScript object to our draw a callback function.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,800
And once our callback function is called, code will execute until it

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,710
hits the debugger statement, in which execution would stop, and

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,820
it will put us into the Chrome debugger at this exact line.
