1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,820
If we try to navigate to local host,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,350
port 8000 with our web browser, you see that nothing's being loaded.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,742
This either means that we have not started our server yet, or

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,550
there is running on a different port.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,790
In our case, we haven't started the server, so let's go ahead and do that.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,600
Switch over to your terminal application.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,930
And first check which directory you're in with the Unix present working

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,870
directory command.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,150
You can see here we're in the Udacity home

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,130
folder in the data visualization folder.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,520
So this I think's where our files are, but

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,640
let's just double check again using the LS Unix command to list the files.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,460
We can see here we have basic_charts.html, which

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,000
is the file that contains our HTML and JavaScript to display our visualization.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,220
And we also have world_cup.tsv, our

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,920
data file with information about the World Cup games.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,360
Next we need to start the web server to serve both the data file

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,120
since D3 uses AJAX to load external files and our HTML file so

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,660
that we don't run into any cross origin request issues.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,020
I'll be using Python's built in module,

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,150
SimpleHTTPServer, to serve my files on local host port 8000.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,930
As you can see here, Python tells me we're serving HTTP on 0.0.0,

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,209
which is an alias for local host and port 8000.
