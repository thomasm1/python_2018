1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,480
The last point I want to touch on with the Dimple library.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,840
And usually this is possible with any library built on D3,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,450
is how we can interact with the dimple-created charts with native JavaScript,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,129
CSS or D3 code to add additional customizations.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,670
Here we can see the chart that we created as a combination of a dimple

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,210
scatter and a dimple line.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,960
But one improvement that I wanted to add is to

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,130
color the scatter circles red to draw more attention to them or

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,190
we can do this through dimple code D3 code or Java Script code.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,410
The simplest way to make this slight change is to use CSS.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,200
When customizing a chart created by another higher level library,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,020
we often need to find some class or ID to select the elements.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,200
In this case the circles.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,400
If we inspect element and look at the SVG created by dimple we can see here that

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,110
its a circle element with the ID equal to the date.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,230
And going over further,

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,760
we can see that there's a bunch of different classes added to it.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,780
Since, we want to make all the circles red, the ID won't work.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,380
So we have to pick one of the classes, or

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,270
a few of them to change the styling on all the circles.

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,110
In this case, it looks like all the circles are dimple series-1 class.

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,970
Which is probably a good guess for

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,370
a class attached to all of the circles and none of the lines.

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,250
Which we can then use in a CSS selector.

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,650
In our HTML file we simply need to add a CSS style to the page as a whole.

26
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,760
That selects circles with dimple series-1 class.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,470
Here we are selecting the circle elements with dimple series-1.

28
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,830
And we're changing the fill property of the SVG circle to be red.

29
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,930
Saving our file and reloading our page.

30
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,230
And you can see here that the fill of the circles is now red,

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,150
which makes them a little bit more distinguishable.
