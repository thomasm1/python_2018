1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,440
For much of this class we will be working with the data set of

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,540
World Cup game statistics.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,740
Each row of our data set represents a single World Cup game,

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,650
excluding preliminary games.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,360
And each column represents some piece of information on the game.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,160
Here we have the year of the World Cup in which the game was played,

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,170
the time the game happened at.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,520
The full date including the day and the month.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,910
The two teams that played, team 1 and team 2.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,670
The number of people who attended the match in person at the stadium.

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,030
Which stage of the World Cup the match occurred in.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,120
The final score of the game.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,050
The first number representing Team 1's score.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,410
And the second number representing Team 2's score.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,490
And whether or not the game went to penalty kicks.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,270
One point on this is that penalty kicks only happen if the game was

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,720
tied by the time it ended.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,640
Which chart, type of the charts we've covered earlier in

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,750
this lesson do you think is most suited to present the total attendance for

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,230
a given year of the World Cup?

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,530
In other words, you would aggregate all the rows of the games for

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,830
the same year and sum up the attendance for every one of those games.

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,820
And also think about, why would you choose that chart?

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,640
Please choose only one of the chart types below that you think

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,770
best represents the data, and also think about why you've chosen that chart.
