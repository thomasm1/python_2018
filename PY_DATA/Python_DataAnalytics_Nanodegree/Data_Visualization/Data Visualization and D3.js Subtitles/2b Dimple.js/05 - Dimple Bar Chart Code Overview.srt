00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,620
One last note here is that we need to load in the dimple.js library in

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,420
addition to D3.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,380
Let's go to our text editor and

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,130
look at our template file that we'll be working with.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,620
As you can see here,

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,920
it's a pretty standard HTML file as you've seen in lesson one.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,850
And as you can see at the top here, we first load in d3.js from D3's site.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,720
And the second script that we're loading in is dimple.js from dimple's site.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,090
Now it may not seem like a big deal but it's important that you put the script

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:41,270
to load the dimple library right below the script to load D3's library.

11
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,270
Since D3 should be loaded before dimple.js gets loaded.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,140
As you can see here, in the head of our web page,

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,870
we have the familiar draw function which will get called with D3 loads in data.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,060
And what we have here is a bunch of code to create a chart in Dimple.js.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,630
I don't want to go through this just yet, but

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,550
I want to show you the structure of the file we're working with.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,900
And just at the bottom here we have the familiar script tags in

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,290
the body which makes a standard call to D3 to load in

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,950
our tab separated values file world cup.tsv.

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,670
And once our data gets loaded we'll pass the data to our draw function which we

21
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,380
defined above.
