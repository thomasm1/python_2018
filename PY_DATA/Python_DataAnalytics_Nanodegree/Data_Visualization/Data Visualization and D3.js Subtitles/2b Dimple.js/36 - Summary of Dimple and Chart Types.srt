00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,059
I just want to recap what we did in this lesson and

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,760
remind you of the iterative process of sketching a visualization.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,540
We started with our bar chart.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,760
Notice that while it does some things well, such as highlight when games were

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,270
not held, it doesn't really convey the trend in time that well.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,710
And also it looks a bit strange since the bars are so

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,980
thin, since they represent only one year.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,290
We then went to a scatter plot, which shows the trend a little bit better,

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,890
as we can follow the circles as they rise and

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,000
fall, captures the missing years in which a game was not held.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,390
But not nearly as well as the bar chart.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,000
But is typically used to represent things where the values on

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,370
the x-axis aren't necessarily correlated or ordered.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,950
While the scatter plot has some of the benefits of the bar chart and

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,260
some of the benefits of a line plot, it does a bit of a mediocre job at both.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,630
We then tried to iterate with a line plot, since it is most suited for

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,560
time series data, and conveys trends very well.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,920
Here we can easily see the trend in attendances over the history of

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,370
the World Cup, but tends to obscure dates where there was no data or

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,050
a game was not held.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,340
So to remedy this, we're going to add our scatter dots back in

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,540
to show that because of where lower two, there were no World Cups games held.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,780
And then to make the data points, in this case the circles more striking,

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,820
we can style them with CSS to make them red.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,830
And to add context, we added a title.

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,800
I kept the title in here the whole time through the duration.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
Since it's usually a good practice.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,670
You start with both a title and labels on your axis.

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,040
So that even though the visual display of your data may not be the perfect

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,730
ideal, you or a reader still has the sense of what data you're looking at.

31
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,520
And that concludes the live coding example I wanted to go through.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,240
And hopefully, you have a better sense of the process involved with reaching

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,100
a final graphic.
