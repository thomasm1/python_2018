1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
And the last fix that I wanted to perform was to add a title, so

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,220
that our reader of this chart knows what they're looking at.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,600
As we saw in lesson one, we can manipulate both SVG and HTML elements with D3.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,850
So let's add a header tag using D3 and then changing the text of that.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,260
We want the title to come before our chart.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,620
So right before SVG element we can append our header.
