1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,380
The addSeries method call is where we actually specify that we're going to

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,120
make a bar chart.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,720
A quirk of the addSeries method, that the first argument

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,120
specifies a field to create categories for the chart to group the data by.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,500
In this case, if we gave the method something like stage of each game,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,750
then we create a stacked bar chart, or whichever chart we specify where it

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,070
facets the data based on the field, that you pass in as the first argument.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,250
In this case, and we'll see in just a minute,

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,340
if we specify stage, we'll actually be representing the attendance for

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,130
each stage of the World Cup for a given year.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,080
Since we want to first see the attendance across all games for

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,190
each year, we're going to pass in null,

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,950
which just means to not group the data on any other field.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,160
The last step is to draw our chart and see all the hard work that Dimple has

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,300
done for us, here we just call the draw method on our myChart object,

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,400
which we added all of our axises and the series to.
