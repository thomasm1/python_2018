1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,819
I'll start with the good.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,940
One thing that the bar chart does well,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,670
is highlight the years in which the data is missing.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,610
Both in between World Cups, so

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,480
it's very obvious the World Cup only happens every four years.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,950
But also through the use of negative space,

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,580
we can see complete years in which there was no World Cup at all.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,480
Can you think of what major event occurred in these years?

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
Somewhere between 1938 and 1950 that would cause the World Cup to be canceled.
