00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,130
The first chart I will try is a bar chart.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,569
To do this with Dimple there are a few steps to go through, but

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,170
many less than doing this with D3 itself, which we will see later in the lesson.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,771
I want to talk through my coding the editor, before we move back to

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:19,350
the browser and interactively explore what each of these lines does.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,710
The conventions that Dimple works with are axis, series and fields,

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,190
which I'll call them here to not confuse them with JavaScript variable, though

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,810
they are more closely related to what the grammar of graphics calls variables.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,350
And fields simply refer to columns in our dataset.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,660
Here, attendance is the attendance column.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,770
These three features are the essential building blocks of any chart and

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,580
by manipulating each of these we can create a wealth of diverse charts.
