There are a few more methods that D3 defines on a selection object that allow

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,960
you to transform and mutate DOM nodes.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,070
If you're curious about all the possible options,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,010
I suggest reading through D3's API docs on their site, or

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,500
by simply exploring the selection objects using Chrome's autocomplete.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,160
In this case,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm going to store the return value of the selection into a variable header.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,860
And now with my header dominoed, I can try to call a function on it and

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,510
see what the Chrome console tries to autocomplete.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,880
Calling header dot shows not only the functions D3 defines but

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,080
any function I could possibly call on the object I'm working with.
