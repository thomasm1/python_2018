00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,450
One thing that might have made you uneasy,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,090
is that when we selected our header element, we simply chose a class name and

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,910
assumed it to be unique, or hoped it was.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,870
Typically, you cannot make the assumption that a class name is unique

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,380
to a given element.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,520
IDs are typically reserved as unique identifiers that don't show up

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,340
on any other HTML or DOM nodes throughout the page.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,890
But classes could, and often are, applied to many different HTML tags.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,040
We can test whether navbar static top

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,070
was indeed unique by using d3's selectAll function.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,310
SelectAll works in just the same way as select.

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,120
Except for instead of returning one,

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,560
it returns all the elements that match the selection.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,920
As you can see here,

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,470
I'm trying to select every header with class navbarstatic top on the page.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,720
Luckily for us, what gets returned is a single element.
