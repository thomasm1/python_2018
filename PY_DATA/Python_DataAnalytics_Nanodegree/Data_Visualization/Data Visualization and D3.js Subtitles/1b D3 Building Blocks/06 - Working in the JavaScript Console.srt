1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,690
The JavaScript console in the Chrome Developer Tools can be

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,160
accessed by clicking on the Console tab, if it's not already open, and

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,270
is actually a full featured JavaScript interpreter.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,360
We can execute any arbitrary JavaScript, 5 plus 7, and we get returned 12.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,760
Or we can even create functions, and

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,780
when executed, gets add to the scope of the console window.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,850
Here, we can see I defined a function named my_fun, and

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,950
when called, simply returns hello world.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,880
So inspecting that in the console.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,025
Notice as I start typing my, the Chrome console knows that

11
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:44,020
my_fun has been defined and tries to auto-complete it.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,600
Typing tab, I can auto-complete it.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,040
And if I leave the parenthesis off,

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,350
what gets returned is simply the definition of that function.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,450
This is a subtlety, but fairly important point.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,290
The definition of a function, in this case, what should get

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,740
run when it's called is separate from actually running that function.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,647
As you can see here,

19
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:11,100
my_fun without parenthesis, simply returns the definition of that function.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,720
But if I called my_fun with parenthesis,

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,508
it signals to call the function and return hello world in this case.

22
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:24,448
If your console window is getting too cluttered, you can use a clear function,

23
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:30,780
or if you're on a Mac Cmd+K to clear out everything that's been run before.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,270
Also, if you type the up or down arrow keys,

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,915
you can scroll through the history of commands which you've run in the console.
