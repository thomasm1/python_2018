00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,520
Something I've been leaving off in all of the console commands I've

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,120
been running is an ending semicolon.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,400
The inclusion or exclusion of a semicolon at the end of every line of

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,650
JavaScript has caused some disagreements in the JavaScript community.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,990
In the language specification, it requires you, if you're trying to

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,950
be perfectly correct, to end every statement with a semicolon.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,600
What's happened since JavaScript's come out, though,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,720
is that people often forget semicolons, and the JavaScript interpreter, or

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,830
the browser, tries to make a best guess effort as what you meant.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,470
You can get by without using semicolons, but it's best to be explicit.
