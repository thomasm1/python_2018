1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,200
Now there are just a few more nuances to the library and

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,360
steps we need to take before we can go from the source code of our

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,710
D3 visualization to a pretty graphic in the library.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,320
We have seen the source of a complete D3 visualization,

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,970
in this case a horizontal bar chart, and

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,740
we have played around with D3 in a web browser console.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,950
But how exactly do we go from a source file to what's displayed in

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,050
the web browser?

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,510
Every URL has four basic components.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,590
Sometimes, if you're using a modern browser, Chrome included, they hide

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,110
the first part of http:// since it's often common across all URLs.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,500
HTTP in this case, corresponds to the protocol that was used to load the page.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,480
If you simply double-click on HTML file, with out going to a web server,

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,960
you may see file:// meaning that it was loaded with the file protocol.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,750
The second portion of the URL, in this case,

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,510
localhost, corresponds to the host or server from which the file was loaded.

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,760
Since we're running a local web server to serve both our HTML and

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,470
our data, it's simply localhost, meaning the current machine.

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,920
The next section of the URL, which come after the colon, in this case 8000,

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,540
refers to the port.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,520
If we think of our host, or

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,030
our server, as an apartment complex then the port would be

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,810
which individual unit of that apartment complex we would like to access.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,910
So again the host might be the address of the apartment building and

25
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,390
the port might be the number of the apartment unit.

26
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,220
And finally what comes after the port in this

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,720
case let's_make_a_bar_chart.html is the file you'd like to load.
