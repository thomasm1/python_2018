1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,440
Again, I want to stress that one of the most powerful features of

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,310
D3 could be considered its API and how it makes you think.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,860
Since every method in D3 returns the element or

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,570
elements that it was called on, you can naturally chain methods one to the next.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,650
Don't worry about all the changes we've been making to the page.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,220
Any changes we make are purely on the client side, meaning only within our

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,570
local browser, and of we refresh the page Udacity's site goes back to normal.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,080
So now, let us refresh the page and

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,600
then start manipulating with a fresh HTML page.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,430
After we've refreshed the page,

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,440
you can see that the navigation bar has its original background and

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,580
the title is back to Data Visualization rather than Jon's Pretty Pictures.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,400
I wanted to walk through how to actually change the logo and

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,850
what's happening behind the scenes in more depth.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,450
The first step, as always, is to inspect the element and try to find some

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,570
unique identifier, either a class ID or tag, to use with D3 select function.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,530
As you can see here the logo is in image tag but it doesn't have any classes or

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,000
ID's defined on it.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,030
Does this mean that we will not be able to select it?

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,810
No, we simply have to look one level up or as many levels up as we need and

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,280
navigate the dom tree from the closest identifiable element.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,940
What does that mean exactly?

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,040
Well, going one level up to its parent, the image tag is contained

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,570
within an a tag, and this a tag, as you can see when you hover, highlights

25
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,270
the Audacity logo, meaning that the image is indeed a subselection of the a tag.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,725
And looking at its class of logo and

27
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:49,335
navbar brand, I'd be willing to bet that if I search for a with both logo and

28
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:53,625
navbar-brand, I'll find a unique element which returns this selection.

29
00:01:53,625 --> 00:02:00,753
So calling d3.select with a.navbar-brand.logo, which again is looking for

30
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:05,757
both navbar-brand and logo classes defined on the a tag.

31
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:10,729
Again, as you see here, we get a return with a D3 Array object.

32
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,230
And inspecting inside we see indeed there is an a tag

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,060
that has .logo.navbar which uniquely identifies it and

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,830
corresponds to the logo that we're looking to change.

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,825
Since this a tag also has an id,

36
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:30,340
header-logo, we can select it using a CSS selector for the id.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,760
The syntax for CSS selectors to select an ID is simply the hash or

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,160
pound symbol, and then the ID following.

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,030
Let's save this selection into a variable.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,520
Let's call it, parent_element.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,340
And now let's try to find a way to get the image tag

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,650
to actually mutate its source.

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,030
Again, because what's returned from the selection has all of

44
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,030
D3's methods defined on it, we can make another sub-selection.

45
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,730
Scrolling through the list of methods defined, we find select.

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,210
We can select within this element and

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,180
arbitrarily select however deep we may need to go.

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,700
In this case, we're lucky and only have to go a single level down.

49
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,330
Also in this case, since there's only a single item within the a tag,

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,140
we know that subselecting an image tag on the previous selection of

51
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,090
the a with ID header-logo, we're guaranteed to get the element of interest.

52
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,100
As you can see here, the image tag we hover and it corresponds to the logo.

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,150
To finish our remodel of Udacity's site,

54
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,540
we simply need to change the source attribute defined on the image tag.

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,750
You can change any attribute defined on any HTML tag using the .attr or

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,030
attribute method defined on a selection or D3 object.

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,620
While we're interested in just changing the source,

58
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,010
you can actually change any attribute, alt text, maybe a class, or an ID.

59
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,010
In this case, let's just try to change the alt text and see what would happen.

60
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,620
Notice as we change the alt to Jon's logo since was displayed in

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,540
the chrome developer console is the dom and not the stated source of the page.

62
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,940
The alt name actually changes in real time to Jon's logo.

63
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,720
To change the source you simply need to change alt to the string source.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,660
And in our case, I've already found the URL for

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,260
the Zipfian logo and stored it in a variable zipf.

66
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,090
Running this line, the source should dynamically update and

67
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,790
that logo image should change.

68
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,010
And voila.

69
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,000
As you can see here the logo has changed to Zipfian Academy's logo, and

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,190
if we hover over the dom representation of this we can see that

71
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,670
indeed the source has changed and it corresponds to the Zipfian Academy logo.
