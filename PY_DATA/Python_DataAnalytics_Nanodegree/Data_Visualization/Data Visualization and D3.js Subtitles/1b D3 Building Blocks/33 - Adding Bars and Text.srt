1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,760
And these last two chunks of code actually add the visual elements to the page.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,470
Notice here that bar is simply a bunch of g tags that have

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,660
some transform on them.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,160
We have not actually put any rectangles on the page or

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,280
any labels on those rectangles.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,480
But since d3 has this nice chainable syntax.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,710
And since any call to append puts elements within the element append

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,890
was called on, in this case bar.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,100
We can add direct angles inside of the group tags.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,640
And this last chunk of code simply adds the textural label which corresponds to

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,130
the value of the data point.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,030
That was all I wanted to cover from a high level of this code.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,470
And just wanted to expose to some of the d3 functions and

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,060
methods that we haven't encountered yet.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,710
And how to apply them to data loaded from an external file
