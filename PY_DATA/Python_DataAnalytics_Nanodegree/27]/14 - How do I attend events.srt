Another way we'll get support in[br]the Nanodegree, is at office hours.

0:00:03.780,0:00:07.254
These sessions happen multiple times[br]each week, and are the perfect place to

0:00:07.254,0:00:10.578
deepen your learning, and ask your[br]questions to the Udacity coach team.

0:00:10.578,0:00:13.640
The schedule is listed in[br]your Nanodegree portal.

0:00:13.640,0:00:17.120
Sessions often start out with coaches[br]talking about common issues students

0:00:17.120,0:00:19.954
encounter, or elaborating on[br]a particular tricky concept.

0:00:19.954,0:00:23.230
Then we move into an open question and[br]answer time.

0:00:23.230,0:00:26.815
Decisions happen over Google Hangouts On[br]Air, so you'll need to request to join

0:00:26.815,0:00:29.096
our Google Plus community[br]to participate in them.

0:00:29.096,0:00:32.020
You'll also need a Google Plus[br]account to join the community, so

0:00:32.020,0:00:33.890
if you don't have that, make one first.

0:00:35.010,0:00:38.005
If you can't attend sessions live,[br]don't worry, they record it.

0:00:38.005,0:00:39.903
You can post your[br]questions in advanced and

0:00:39.903,0:00:43.344
then watch the session afterward if you[br]can't make it, to hear our answers.

0:00:43.344,0:00:45.328
