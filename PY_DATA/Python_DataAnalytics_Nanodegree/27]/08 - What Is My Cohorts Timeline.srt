As I mentioned before,

0:00:01.230,0:00:04.375
the timeline you're working on[br]is specific to your Cohort.

0:00:04.375,0:00:07.290
We've talked already about what a big[br]commitment Nanodegrees are, and

0:00:07.290,0:00:08.250
we designed the timeline for

0:00:08.250,0:00:11.010
this Nanodegree with a commitment[br]of ten hours a week in mind.

0:00:11.010,0:00:15.060
Now you're going to find out what your[br]timeline is in just a second, and please

0:00:15.060,0:00:18.040
note the dates listed are the dates by[br]which you need to submit your projects.

0:00:18.040,0:00:20.860
Now, that doesn't mean you have[br]to have met specifications for

0:00:20.860,0:00:23.180
each of those projects[br]by the dates listed.

0:00:23.180,0:00:25.700
It just means that you need to have[br]put your best effort forward for

0:00:25.700,0:00:26.890
each of those projects.

0:00:26.890,0:00:30.160
And be in a good place to finish[br]them up, if you haven't already.

0:00:30.160,0:00:31.920
Remember though,[br]by the time you graduate,

0:00:31.920,0:00:34.580
you'll need to have met specifications[br]for each of these projects.
