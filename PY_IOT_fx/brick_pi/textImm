<p>I highlight these legal and socio-economic ( explanations for contemporary cultural assimilation patterns in contrast to an increasingly well-defined nationalist viewpoint, exemplified by the current White House administration's legal actions on immigration policy soon to be contested between the 9 recently-united Supreme Court Justices.  <br /> 

First, a word on the issues and the stakes of the modern American immigration policy, and the science underpinning the debates. Social science begins with the collection of individual data on immigrants' ethnic origins and their current legal and socio-economic circumstance. The opposing view dismisses legal and socio-economic data, in favor of the argument that immigrant behavior is determined by the immigrant's nation of origin, and thus genealogical roots and ethnic phenotype.  This latter view is a snapshot of the post-Reconstruction, 1900's-era American belief system  a view that predates contemporary psychology of Skinner, the sociology of Bourdieu, and behavioral economics of Milton Friedman.  Since the era of modern social science, structure-based immigrant behavior is, in a nutshell, operationalized by two variables: legality of stay (as determined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service) and socio-economic ability, i.e. structural needs, wants, and goals, and is operationalized by occupational/income-earning power, educational achievement, and expected duration of stay in the host country.   <br />  <br /> 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, scientific data collection on migrants is made difficult by incognito behavior depending on legality of stay and transience dependent on social-economics. So, it is difficult to maintain a statistically accurate survey results without anonymity due to constant fear of INS exposure. Second, scientific observation cannot keep current with the constant legal and socio-economic flux of an immigrant with high-turnover of residence address and occupation/income.  AI technology and the social media landscape does not resolve the fundamental hurdles faced by the social science of immigrant assimilation. However, sociology of immigration is the best hope to seal the casket on the 1900's, post-Darwinist focus on ethnic identity as the principle determinant of immigrants' cultural assimilation.</p> <br />  
<h1>Structural Drivers of Assimilation</h1>
<h3>Socio-Economic Status and Circumstance 
</h3>
<p>  
Current U.S. immigrants arrive with very disparate legal and socio-economic circumstances.  These two indicators of structural circumstance determine the course of the immigrants' stay.  Accordingly, they determine the pattern of cultural assimilation for each immigrant and their ability to attain the same status and culture as the typical, middle-class American (Suarez-Orozco, 2000).  Cultural assimilation follows hand-in-hand with upward career mobility.  [Assimilation] is the cumulative byproduct of choices made by individuals seeking to take advantage of opportunities to improve their social situations' (Alba, 1995). <br />  <br /> 
Interestingly, the current immigrant arrives in an economic job market that is highly segregated.  Using an hourglass metaphor, there is either a "well-remunerated, knowledge-intensive economic sphere [or] a service economy where low-skilled and semi-skilled workers continue to lose ground in terms of real wages, benefits, and security. Therefore immigrants fall into one or the other labor market" (Suarez-Orozco, 2000). It follows that immigrant groups are statistically divided along the same line as the economic and educational development of the nation of origin. <br />  <br /> 
The U.S. immigrant from any national origin falls into two very different structural categories upon arrival.  They range from highly skilled to unskilled and poorly educated, These circumstances strongly affect the immigrant experience and subsequent pattern of assimilation (Portes and Rumbaut, 1996). The lesser-skilled workers have the only choice of accepting jobs that offer no upward mobility and their housing is forced into urban, ethnically segregated neighborhoods.  The highly skilled workers, with their education and language ability, are offered jobs that support a work and residence lifestyle that involves interaction with middle-class America, while at the same time prospering cultural assimilation.  For this reason, Portes and Rumbaut (2001) identify two prominent types of immigrant assimilation. The first type is able to adopt mainstream American customs, speaks English, and is upwardly mobile within one or two generations.  The second type, based on socio-economic circumstances, acculturates to inner-city subcultures, low education level and labor market, even after several generations.   <br />  <br /> </p>
<h3>Expectation of Stay and Legality</h3>
<p>   
In the past, immigrants had few opportunities to communicate, visit, or even return to the sending nation, thereby facilitating the process of cultural assimilation.  Expected length of stay and naturalization of the immigrant in the host nation is an essential element in the immigrant's desire to assimilate.  If the immigrant plans to stay temporarily in the host nation, there is less need to learn the culture of the host nation (Guarnizo, 2003).  For example, one in five Mexican immigrants will choose to acquire American citizenship (Chavez, 1998).  Guarnizo says that propensity to engage in entrepreneurial ventures varies systematically with the socially-expected duration (SED) of migration.  In other words, temporary SED's  "preserve ties with the country and community of origin."  Of course, SED is primarily affected by legality of stay and the option to naturalize.  Whether the immigrant works illegally, holds a temporary worker visa or is naturalized has a tremendous impact on the immigrant's SED. 
Because of mass transportation, transnationalism has revolutionized the concept of the immigration process by invalidating the traditional "clean break" assumption globalized communication and information technologies immigrants are no longer tied to one country (Suarez-Orozco, 2000).  Furthermore, developing nations support dual-nationality in order to encourage monetary remittances from former emigrants temporarily residing in other nations.  Developed nations encourage temporary worker immigrants in order to fill gaps in labor market.  These factors affect both the expectation of stay and the legality question among immigrants into the United States.  The bottom line is that immigrants that stay temporarily or expect to be deported for legal reasons are not likely to assimilate into American culture.

<h3>Anti-Science Huntingtonian Doctrine on Cultural Assimilation  </h3>
<p>
In the past, U.S. immigration has been likened to the Tomato Soup analogy, that is, tomatoes provide the substance, but immigration provides the herbs and spice.  All immigrants regardless of origin and socio-economic circumstance find a niche in American society, eventually adopting its culture over one or two generations.  However, the inherent racism of Huntingtonian doctrine departs from science by claiming an exception to the rule:  Mexican immigration differs from past and present immigration trends.  The generalization is that certain ethnic groups are less willing to culturally assimilate.  According to this theoretical viewpoint, the ethnic identity and culture of the incoming Mexican immigrant repudiates, like oil with water, fundamental aspects of American culture such as language, values, and norms. <br />  <br /> 
For this cause, Huntingtonian doctrine predicts a potential bifurcation, again like oil with water, of American society.  This predicted bilingual and bicultural division will ultimately lead to a bicognitive American self-identity and culture.  "Unlike past immigrant groups," Huntington writes, "Mexicans and other Latinos have not assimilated into mainstream U.S. culture, forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves ... and rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built the American dream" (Huntington, 2004).  The growing popularity of racist notions poses an existential threat to American identity, and yet few understand any causal explanation; for this reason, one must search for cultural origins to understand their current evolution.
</p> <br /> 
<p>Huntingtonian doctrine asserts two principles for asserting that immigrants of Mexican origin are less likely to culturally assimilate than other immigrant groups. The first principle is that of the uniqueness of Mexican immigration based on geography and history.  Six features differentiate Mexican immigration from other waves of past and present immigrant groups, thereby precluding comparison to historical precedent--a foundational tenet upon which Huntingtonian doctrine relies. <br />  <br />  These features include, 1) the ratio of geographical contiguity and economic disparity between the sending nation and the host nation, 2) the number and rate of immigration, 3) preponderant illegality of entrance and stay, 4) inter-state migrating pattern and formation of Mexican-only regional concentrations, 5) political and economic entente between sending nation and host nation, and 6) historical relevance that most southwest territory was previously under Mexican rule.  According to Huntington, these national facts about Mexican immigrants lessen the need, in theory, for Mexican immigrants to assimilate to American culture.  Huntington's contention is that because of national origin, the Mexican immigrant is less likely to adopt American values than other immigrant groups, regardless of the structural circumstance of the individual.    </p><p> <br /> 
The doctrine's second principle is the lack of incentive of Mexican immigrants to culturally assimilate compared to other immigrating groups into the U.S.  Huntington writes that "many Mexican-American immigrants simply do not appear to identify primarily with the United States" (Huntington, 2004).  Huntington claims that the two cultures are hardly compatible on many levels.  For example, Anglo-Protestant culture is very individualistic and Mexican culture is community-oriented.  Furthermore, Huntington asserts that career and ambition are high priorities of Anglo-Protestant culture, while family and leisure are prioritized in Mexican culture.  For this reason, the Mexican immigrant is not willing to assimilate to the lifestyle and cultural norms of the typical American.   <br />  <br />  
The indicators of lifestyle and American cultural norms are as follows: 1) Sole usage of the English language in public, 2) desire for high educational goals (especially among the youth), 3) continual desire for higher occupational goals (managerial positions), 4) continual desire for greater income, 5) intermarriage, 6) self-identification as American, 7) desire for naturalization and citizenship.    </p> <br /> 
<h3>Conclusion and the Threat of Inaction to Xenophobia and Racism</h3><p> <br /> 
According to the Huntingtonian doctrine, immigrants are less willing to pursue these goals than other immigrant groups.  The primary claim is the ethno-cultural difference between the national culture of Mexico and the national culture of the U.S.  For example, Samuel Huntington wrote, "the cultural division between Hispanics and Anglos could replace the racial division between blacks and whites as the most serious cleavage in U.S. society" (Huntington, 2004).  It is a controversial subject among political analysts to posit that cultures from certain ethnic groups have differing compatibility with American culture.  For example, South Asians (Indians, Bangladeshi, and Pakistanis) assimilate more quickly because their culture, through history, is more compatible with Anglo-Protestant culture.  Upon arrival, they are already highly fluent in English and are familiar with Anglo-Protestant culture because of British colonial influence (Kurlantzick, 2002).  The anti-science community depends on anecdotal information and examples to support its reasoning because fictive reasoning always passes for fact without a sound counter-narrative from opposing ideologies. This resounding voice of reason and science, however, is becoming silenced by the cutting of public social science funding for voices like the National Institutes of Health. And so as it is often headlined by the Washington Post, "Only in Silence Can Democracies Die."  </p>
