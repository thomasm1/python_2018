This is our own custom version image for the BrickPi.  It's a modified Raspbian image with a few changes:

This version is setup to:
	- Boot to desktop.
	- Accept a US keyboard (USA!)
	- SSH Enabled with default login (pi, raspberry)
	- VNC Login on Port 1, password raspberr
	- Auto connect for wlan 
	- Automatically connect over ethernet or wifi to the ip address "raspberrypi.local"
	
Most importantly to note, for the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the BrickPi, the following changes have been made to Wheezy:
	- A modified version of Wiring Pi is installed.
	- The UART clock speed is set to init_uart_clock=32000000
	- Serial and I2C is enabled.
