The goal of this project is to launch a high altitude balloon with the BrickPi as cargo.  You can see more about it on our website in the [Space Program](http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/design/space-program/) section.

## Payload Goals

We will be carrying the following instruments:
* Raspberry Pi Camera
* dPressure
* dGPS
* dThermal Open

We want to take the following data:
* A picture every 10 seconds.
* A pressure reading every 10 seconds.
* A GPS reading every 60 seconds.
* A temperature reading every 60 seconds. 

Remember to [enable camera!](http://www.raspberrypi.org/camera)
We will use Python for all data.  The program will be a simple data-collection program.
We need to have the program run on startup so if there's a power interruption, the program reliably restarts.
We need to conserve power, as much as possible.
